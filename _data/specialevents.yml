  - title: "Improving Geographic Diversity at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium"
    event: global
    day: Thursday, March 11
    time: 8:00 AM-12:00 PM (ET) and 8:00 PM-12:00 AM (ET)
    organizers: Brett Becker (University College Dublin), Amber Settle (DePaul University), Rodrigo Duran (Federal Institute of Mato Grosso do Sul)

    description: "The ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) is one of the oldest and largest SIGs, and the SIGCSE Technical Symposium is the oldest and largest of the four SIGCSE conferences. However, over the past decade an average of 92% of symposium attendees are from the U.S. and 96% are from North America. Because SIGCSE is an international organization with members in well over 100 countries, this lack of geographic diversity and representation is troubling for SIGCSE because it may stifle collaboration, future membership, professional development, and dissemination of research, amongst many other effects. Further, improving geographic diversity is likely to improve many other types of diversity.  <br><br>The goal of this event is to solicit input from attendees from around the globe, including both those who have previously attended the symposium and those who have not yet had a chance to attend. We want to understand what barriers potential attendees may face, how the SIGCSE organization and the TS leadership can work to remove those barriers, and spread word about various ways that SIGCSE engages members living outside North America."
