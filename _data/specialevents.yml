  - title: "Improving Geographic Diversity at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium"
    event: global
    day: Thursday, March 11
    time: 8:00 AM - 12:00 PM (ET) and 8:00 PM - 12:00 AM (ET)
    organizers: Brett Becker (University College Dublin), Amber Settle (DePaul University), Rodrigo Duran (Federal Institute of Mato Grosso do Sul)
    contact: global@sigcse2021.org
    description: "The ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) is one of the oldest and largest SIGs, and the SIGCSE Technical Symposium is the oldest and largest of the four SIGCSE conferences. However, over the past decade an average of 92% of symposium attendees are from the U.S. and 96% are from North America. Because SIGCSE is an international organization with members in well over 100 countries, this lack of geographic diversity and representation is troubling for SIGCSE because it may stifle collaboration, future membership, professional development, and dissemination of research, amongst many other effects. Further, improving geographic diversity is likely to improve many other types of diversity.  <br><br>The goal of this event is to solicit input from attendees from around the globe, including both those who have previously attended the symposium and those who have not yet had a chance to attend. We want to understand what barriers potential attendees may face, how the SIGCSE organization and the TS leadership can work to remove those barriers, and spread word about various ways that SIGCSE engages members living outside North America."

    description: "The SIGCSE Organization is required to hold a business meeting each year. Normally this meeting is held during the Technical Symposium. Due to the virtual nature of the symposium this year and the challenges in scheduling in this new format, the board felt it best to hold the annual business meeting immediately following the conference.<br><br>As with the online business meeting last year, we are providing two opportunities for the SIGCSE membership to attend the meeting. Both meetings will present the same content, but are at different times to try to accommodate as much of our global audience as possible.<br><br>These meetings will be recorded and posted to the SIGCSE website. If you have questions you would like to submit to the board before the meetings, please use this Google form: <a href='https://forms.gle/29D96uyavhwyQd1Y8'>https://forms.gle/29D96uyavhwyQd1Y8</a>"
