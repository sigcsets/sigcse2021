  - title: "How Google Supports and Uses CS Education Research"
    supporter: Google
    day: TBD
    time: TBD
    presenters: Chris Stephenson (Google); Stephanie Marken (Gallup); Sloan Davis (Google); Sepi Moghadam (Google); Kyle Jennings (Google)
    description: "Over the last few years, much work has been done by the CS education community to support and conduct rigorous education research that enables a greater understanding of how CS is best taught and learned. Given that post-secondary CS programs are operating significantly beyond capacity, and that many states are mandating CS for all K–12 students, our relatively small body of rigorous research is impinging on our capacity to best serve an increasing number of students.  This session focuses on how Google is supporting the growth of the CS research community and applying new standards and practices to its own programs. Attendees will learn about several programs that provide funding to encourage and support research and grow the future research pipeline as well as how Google conducts and uses education research to evaluate and improve its programs."

    supporter: GitHub Education
    day: TBD
    time: TBD
    presenters: Jeff Olson (Director of Curriculum & Instruction, GitHub)
    description: "Jeff has used Git & GitHub with students in both introductory and advanced high school courses, fine-tuning strategies for introducing Git in low-stakes and non-threatening ways and building to greater comfort & fluency over time. His strategies emphasize Git as a tool for project collaboration and personal organization, allowing Git to be integrated into your own projects & tasks no matter the programming language or IDE. Participants will see a lesson progression for developing understanding with Git & GitHub, including several Unplugged lesson ideas that can be done without computers. He'll also share his own journey through introducing Git to students, including pitfalls and strategies to avoid. Ultimately, even though Git is an industry standard tool for developers, Jeff doesn't think this should be the only reason for students to learn it; his goal is to describe strategies & resources that can motivate all students to see GitHub as a useful tool in their own journey through computer science, even if this doesn't lead directly into a career in software development."

  - title: "Using GitHub for multi-college collaborative undergraduate research"
    supporter: GitHub Education
    day: TBD
    time: TBD
    presenters: Amos Johnson (Morehouse College)
    description: "Virginia Tech and Morehouse College are currently in the second semester of a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP). This experiential learning effort involves creating a long-term, multi-college, and multidisciplinary undergraduate research project in the technical area of deep learning applied to wireless communications. Due to COVID-19, the project has morphed into a completely online experience, with GitHub as the communications focal point. This change in structure has provided unique challenges in ensuring continued student engagement, collaboration, and research output—along with some unintended benefits. In this presentation, you’ll get an overview of the program, goals and motivations, and current status. In addition, the speakers will provide a unique look at how COVID-19 has led to necessary improvements in collaboration as a beneficial long term side-effect. You’ll come away with best practices for engaging students from diverse colleges, disciplines, and backgrounds effectively while maximizing student engagement and outcomes, especially in pure, or hybrid, online settings."

    day: TBD
    time: TBD
    presenters: "Jacqueline Russell (Program Manager - Microsoft MakeCode); Katie Henry (North America Lead, Micro:bit Educational Foundation)"
    description: "The micro:bit is a tiny educational computing device that has taken the world by storm with more than 25 million children learning to code with the micro:bit in over 60 countries.  The latest version of the micro:bit recently released, opens up new creative possibilities with an on-board speaker and microphone.  Join us to learn more about this new device and follow along to build some sample projects like a sound emotion badge in Microsoft MakeCode.  We'll also cover some best practices for physical computing in remote learning environments and review free classroom resources."

    supporter: Microsoft
    day: TBD
    time: TBD
    presenters: "Margaret Price (Principal Strategist - Microsoft); Dr. Sarah Guthals (Principal - Microsoft)"
    description: "We expect to see 150 million tech or tech-adjacent jobs over the next five years. Those who create with technology will shape our future, and there shouldn’t be barriers to learning the skills required to do so. To help meet this demand, we must make technical and non-technical learning more accessible to anyone who wants to learn. We must evolve industry and academic partnerships. We must address gaps in digital platforms to facilitate seamless and collaborative learning. We must help build a more inclusive future by fostering culture change, increasing diversity, and enabling a sense of belonging. Join us to learn about:<ul><li>Our approach to inclusive problem framing and solving for complex topics like experiential learning, tooling, mentorship, culture change, and curricula</li><li>New learn-to-code curricula created in partnership with NASA, Wonder Woman, Netflix, Lebron James</li><li>New evidence-based problem-solving, collaboration, and resilience curricula called ''life changing'' by students who opted to stick with rather than drop out of CS1 Fall 2020 after going through it</li><li>Partnership opportunities: How might we collaborate with you?</li></ul>"

    supporter: CodeGrade
    day: TBD
    time: TBD
    presenters: Youri Voet (CodeGrade)
    description: "In this session, Youri Voet, CEO and co-founder of CodeGrade, will guide you through converting a fully manually graded programming course step by step to a powerful (semi) automated course.<br><br>First, we will simply start by using some powerful manual feedback tools offered in CodeGrade, such as inline comments and snippets. Then, we will add a rubric to give the students clear objectives and make grading explainable and consistent. Once we have an efficient manual environment set up, we will start adding basic automated tests to provide instant feedback to students and improve quality of code. Once comfortable with this, we will start increasing the complexity of the tests to further automate the grading process. Reducing the time spent marking allows the grader to focus on the important aspects of giving feedback to learners. Lastly, we will show you how to check for code plagiarism and analyze your assignment.<br><br>This session will show you from end to end how you would set up and convert an assignment to a powerful graded CodeGrade assignment."
