    title : "Adopting, Integrating, and Evaluating Computational Creativity Exercises and an Experience Report"
    presenters :
    ad : "In this workshop, participants will learn about how to integrate computational thinking and creative thinking activities that have been shown to significantly improve student learning and performance in their classes via rigorous research investigations.  In particular, participants will be familiarized with the suite of Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs) (which are non-programming-based, group-based, active learning exercises), practice hands-on how to complete such an CCE, learn about how to integrate and adapt them into their courses, and be exposed to the educational research studies behind the development, design, and administration of these CCEs. Participants will also learn how to conduct evidence-based educational research studies.  Workshop sessions will include presentations, panel-based Q&A, an experience report, breakout group discussions, and hands-on activities. Let’s compute, create, and collaborate!<br/><br/>Workshop registration fees and adoption and implementation stipend of $500 will be covered by an NSF grant for the first 10 participants who submit their own one-page statement of purpose to the organizers and participate fully in the workshop.<br/><br/>For more information on the workshop, please see: cse.unl.edu/agents/ic2think/CCEWorkshop2021"

    title : "How to Gamify Your Computing Classes"
    presenters :
    ad : "Are you looking for new ways to better engage your students? Do you want to try making your Computer Science course more attractive? We can help! Come and see what the OneUp course gamification platform offers! In this workshop you will learn how you can gamify your own classes using game design elements such as avatars, points, leaderboards, progress bars, goal-setting, badges, virtual currency, duels, etc., and will get hands-on practice with using OneUp. For each workshop attendee, an OneUp course shell will be created and populated with sample data for individual use. For this virtual workshop, you will need the Chrome web browser installed on your laptop/computer, so that you can connect to OneUp. The workshop registration fees will be refunded by an NSF grant for the first 15 registered participants. "

    title : "Building and hacking an exploitable WiFi environment for your classroom – even for remote participants!"
    presenters :
    ad : "In this workshop, you will learn (1) how to build an exploitable WiFi environment for your classroom, (2) how Raspberry Pis can be used to act as the necessary clients for your access points, (3) how to setup a VPN and Raspberry Pis to allow remote access to the environment, and (4) how to hack the access points. You will also have access to all of the Raspberry Pi scripts and access point configuration directions. Then, you will get a chance to hack up to four WEP access points as well as a WPA2 access point. Note: Participants must have a laptop with VirtualBox installed and at least 25GB of disk space available. Before the workshop, you will be provided a link to download and import a tested Kali VM as well as VPN credentials to participate in the hands-on hacking activity."

    title : "Real-World Data, Interactive Games and Data Structure Visualizations in Early CS Courses Using BRIDGES"
    presenters :
    ad : "Are you looking for ways to spice up your CS1, CS2, Data Structures, or Algorithm course? Come to our BRIDGES training workshop at SIGCSE 2021! BRIDGES provides a toolkit that lets you easily bring in interesting real-world data into your course assignments and allow your students to build simple games, create data structure visualizations, and assess algorithm performance. See the examples at http://bridgesuncc.github.io/ Bring a laptop! Bridges partners will be provided stipends for providing student feedback and experience using BRIDGES."
