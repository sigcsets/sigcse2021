### Review Guidelines

SIGCSE Technical Symposium workshop proposals are reviewed within EasyChair. Please ensure that you have followed all of the guidelines in the [General Review Process](/reviewers/general-review-process).

In addition to the general review process, indicate in your review whether the proposed activity/structure is reasonable with respect to an online BOF.
