## Overview

<!-- Opening paragraphs are the same as authors guidelines -->
[Demos](/authors/demos) provide a way to showcase an educational tool or project in a live setting. Not designed to be sales pitches, demonstrations are a way for the community to see the relevance, potential and innovation of the tool and allow time for discussion with its creator. 

For SIGCSE TS 2021, Demos will be a maximum of 20 minutes each, with at least 10-15 minutes allocated for answering questions. The Demo format is significantly different this year with Demos held in a regular session at a fixed timeslot, rather than during coffee breaks where the longer time slot was used to accommodate audience members arriving at different times. These changes have been introduced to accommodate the virtual setting of the symposium to the best extent possible.

## Review Guidelines

As you write your review, please keep in mind that the Demos are meant to be interactive.  Do the authors describe how they plan to engage with attendees?  Do the proposed **activities fit into the (new for SIGCSE TS 2021) 20-minute time frame**? 

Please provide constructive feedback and clearly justify your choice of rating to help the authors. A review that gives a low score with no written comments is not helpful to the authors since it simply tells the authors that they have been unsuccessful, with no indication of how or why.

Reviewers will be asked to summarize the work, provide their familiarity with the submission topic, describe the expected audience, identify strengths and weaknesses of the submissions, and provide an overall evaluation.  Reviewers may provide confidential comments to the program committee to address concerns about the submission. These comments will not be shared with submitting authors.
