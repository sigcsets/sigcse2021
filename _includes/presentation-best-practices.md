### Best Practices for Recording / Remote Presentations

Here are some best practices to consider as you record your video and prepare for your live session:

* Find a quiet room with as little background noise as possible.
* Make sure you are professionally dressed. 
* Sit in the center of the camera shot to ensure proper camera framing.
* Make sure your face is well lit by sitting in a room with plenty of light. If you can’t find a well-lit room, place a small lamp in front of you but out of the camera view.
* Do not sit in front of a window. This will cause the camera to adjust for the light, making your face look very dark.
* Adjust the camera to be level with your eyes.  This will produce the best camera angle.  If using a laptop, you may need to put your laptop on an elevated surface in order to get the camera level with your eyes.
* Always be aware of what is in the camera shot. Make sure there is nothing sitting in the background that you wouldn’t want viewers to see. 
* Use headphones or earbuds to listen to the audio. This helps with the sound quality and ensures you will always be able to hear clearly.
* Keep your microphone muted during the call unless you are speaking.
* When speaking and not wearing a headset or earbuds, keep your speaker volume at the lowest setting while still being able to hear. This helps get rid of echoes coming back through your microphone. 
* Use a cabled internet connection when possible. Most connection issues are due to a bad wireless connection. 
* Do a test call beforehand to make sure your microphone, speakers and webcam are all working properly.
