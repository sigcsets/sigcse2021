### How do I record my presentation?

An excellent writeup on recording presentations authored by David Ayman Shamma from the SIGCHI community can be found here: [https://medium.com/sigchi/a-remote-video-presentation-guide-93957c63aa7a](https://medium.com/sigchi/a-remote-video-presentation-guide-93957c63aa7a)

__Using Zoom:__

The simplest option is to use Zoom, as it will automatically create the proper file format for you and most of the SIGCSE community is already familiar with the tool.

* Start a meeting with just you as the only participant
* Open your slides and start screen sharing as you normally would in a standard Zoom meeting
* Click "Record" on the main Zoom toolbar at the bottom of the window and select "Record on this Computer"
* Give your presentation, following the best practices for video recordings
* When you are done, stop recording, then stop sharing and end the meeting
* Zoom will automatically convert the video to an .mp4 file format
* Rename the file as instructed and submit via the form emailed to authors from EasyChair

__Using OBS:__

If you would like to have more control over the presentation, including, but not limited to:

* Smoother transitions between your camera full screen and slides
* Multiple audio/video sources
* Graphic boarders around your camera
* Sharing multiple windows at the same time

you may want to try the open source Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) at [http://obsproject.com](http://obsproject.com), available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  OBS does require a lot more configuration and setting up than Zoom, but offers a lot of flexibility and options for free.  (Just remember that OBS records .mkv files by default.  To convert to .mp4, use the "Remux Recordings" option in the File menu.)

__Using Powerpoint/Keynote:__

If you would prefer to not be on camera at all, it is possible to use the "Record Slide Show" option in Powerpoint or Keynote to record a screencast of just your slides.  

__Converting to .mp4:__

If the tool you use does not natively create a .mp4 file for you, you can transcode it for free using Handbrake, found at [https://handbrake.fr/](https://handbrake.fr/).  Choose "Fast 1080p30 preset" to generate the proper file format and size.

__Closed-Captioning:__

Please note that the Technical Symposium is providing a closed-captioning service for all videos (pre-recorded and live) at no cost to you.  We will do all the closed-captioning to ensure a standard experience across all aspects of the Symposium.
