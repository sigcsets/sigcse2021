## Presentation Guidelines

Video presentations must follow these technical guidelines:

* MP4 format encoding
* 1920x1080 (i.e. HD resolution) - If this is not possible for you, please at least record in a 16:9 ratio size
* 30 frames per second (approximately) is preferred to keep file size more reasonable

Presentation Guidelines: Please follow the [SIGACCESS Guidelines](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-presentation-guide/) to create a presentation that all attendees can enjoy and learn from. We summarize the [linked SIGACCESS guidelines](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-presentation-guide/) and add a few more below:

* Choose a high contrast color scheme that supports color blind readers
* Use more than color coding to communicate information
* Keep text brief
* Keep graphics simple and verbally describe images, animations, videos
* Avoid using a pointer
* Caption videos
* Speak clearly, use a microphone, face the audience, and use common, understandable terms
* Post your slides early and provide a link them them on the slides
* Share your contact information
* Download your slides, videos, and sounds locally on your computer; donâ€™t depend on wifi for your presentation
