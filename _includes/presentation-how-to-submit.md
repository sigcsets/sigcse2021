### Why do you need the presentation so soon (January 15)?

Our goal is to make the prerecorded content of the Technical Symposium available a few weeks before the Symposium starts so that attendees can view materials when convenient to them and so they can better build their schedule for the week of the Symposium.  In order to meet that goal, we need to preprocess all the videos as soon as possible to ensure they are ready for the Symposium for reasons including, but not limited to:

* Closed-captioning for all videos (authors do not need to do this on their own - our production company is providing this service)
* Checking format to ensure videos can play properly in Pathable
* Validating the length of videos matches the requirements
