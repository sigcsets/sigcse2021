### How do I submit my video presentation?

A link to the submission form will be sent to the corresponding authors identified in EasyChair.  If you did not receive the email by January 8th or if you have any questions, please email [videosubmission@sigcse2021.org](mailto:videosubmission@sigcse2021.org).

### Why do you need the presentation so soon (January 22)?

Our goal is to make the prerecorded content of the Technical Symposium available a few weeks before the Symposium starts so that attendees can view materials when convenient to them and so they can better build their schedule for the week of the Symposium.  In order to meet that goal, we need to preprocess all the videos as soon as possible to ensure they are ready for the Symposium for reasons including, but not limited to:

* Closed-captioning for all videos (authors do not need to do this on their own - our production company is providing this service)
* Checking format to ensure videos can play properly in Pathable
* Validating the length of videos matches the requirements

_Update:_ We have moved the due date from January 15 to January 22 for all presenters to provide more time for those who wish submit to ITiCSE ([https://iticse.acm.org/for-authors/](https://iticse.acm.org/for-authors/)) or who have more than one video submission they need to make.  However, we would very much appreciate videos to be sent in as soon as possible so that we can ensure we have enough time to process all the submissions.
