The following sessions and events may be of interest to non-US attendees or anyone interested in Geographic Diversity. Sessions and events below are: specifically about geographical diversity (marked *), set in global contexts, and/or are authored by global authors, organized by global organizers, etc. These are listed below in the following order:

- Pre-Symposium Events
- Papers
- Posters 
- Birds of a Feather
- Demonstrations
- Student Research Competition (SRC)
- Workshops

There are many other aspects of diversity that are not included here but may be of interest - again, all of these we feel may be particularly interesting for attendees coming from outside the United States. If you notice something missing or have questions, feel free to contact Brett Becker, the SIGCSE Technical Symposium Global Liaison (global@sigcse2021.org).
