Join us each morning during the SIGCSE Technical Symposium for Morning Coffee - a 30-minute show highlighting all that's going on at the Symposium that day!  Hosted by a rotating cast of Mark Sherriff, Larry Merkle, Pam Cutter, Alvaro Monge, and Judy Sheard, the show will cover the day's calendar, along with interviews with members of the SIGCSE community!

So, join us every morning at 10:00 AM ET with a hot cup in hand for Morning Coffee!
