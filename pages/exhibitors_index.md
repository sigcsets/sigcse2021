### The Premier Event in Computer Science Education
The Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education of the Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM SIGCSE) is a community of approximately 2,600 people whom, in addition to their specialization within computing, have a strong interest in the quality of computing education. The SIGCSE Symposium is the flagship conference of the organization and is regularly attended by more than 2,000 people. Conference attendees are looking for new ideas, textbooks to support their courses, and materials to improve the effectiveness of their teaching. The conference provides a forum for educators to discuss issues related to the development, implementation, and/or evaluation of computing programs, curricula, and courses, as well as syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy. With increased pressure to pursue distance learning and asynchronous learning, attendees will want to find out about the latest innovations in class management systems.

In addition to selecting the textbooks and support materials for their courses, conference attendees influence the choice of computing equipment for their laboratories as well as for their departments. They select the tools that support teaching and their own scholarly work. They also determine what languages will be used in their courses and what compilers and development environments will be installed. These professionals set aside the time of the Symposium to review what is available and make their choices for the coming years. This is the most efficient way to interact with the most active teaching faculty in computing and information science.
