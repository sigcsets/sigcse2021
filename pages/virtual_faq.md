### Q: What software will we use with the Technical Symposium?

A: There are several software packages and services that we have tested after attending numerous virtual conferences this summer.  Our event planning company has tested out even more than we have.  As we evaluate the packages, our main focus is finding the best platform for what we believe our community wants - the ability to easily connect with others while attending the symposium.  

When we have more information regarding the platform, we will let everyone know.  We will want presenters, session chairs, workshop organizers, sponsors, exhibitors, etc. to have the opportunity to get familiar with the platform before the symposium begins.

### Q: How will this affect [insert name of track here]?

A: Track chairs are updating the information in the [Authors section](/authors).  If you have any specific questions, please email the track chairs directly. The [Symposium Committees](/committee) page lists all the track chairs and includes the track-specific email address to contact them.
