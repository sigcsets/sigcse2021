"PT","b768","How Can We Make Office Hours Better?","","1","Most personal student interactions with instructional staff come through office hours. Particularly in large courses, office hours are predominantly run by teaching assistants (TAs). TAs are best advantaged by support and training from more senior instructional staff, especially faculty. This Birds-of-a-Feather session will provide a forum for discussing challenges and innovations in managing office hours towards improving the student learning experience and environment by discussing ideas around (1) personalized support and mentoring for TAs, (2) technological support such as online queues and internal wikis,  (3) considerations for remote teaching and learning, and (4) methods for evaluating office hours. It is hoped that these conversations may inspire transformative changes to office hours structure that lead to future educational innovations in research and in practice. While this session will emphasize TA-supported office hours, the discussion may also inspire new ideas for managing instructor office hours as well. During our session we will create breakout rooms for each topic and use a shared document where each room can take notes. After the break out session, each group will report back and create a summary of their discussion notes, which will be publicly archived at https://kevinl.info/office-hours","Kevin","","Lin","kevinl@cs.uw.edu","Paul G.

"PT","b773","Birds of a Feather Who'd Like to Share Software Together: Teaching Tools that Improve Efficiency and Outcomes","","1","Odds are we've all used (or tried!) quite a few tools to facilitate efficiency inside and outside of the classroom and empower students to learn more effectively. Some of those tools are perhaps homegrown and unique to one's own institution, but freely available educational technologies abound as well, some in the cloud, some for Macs and PCs, some open-source. And quite a few commercial tools offer free or discounted educational plans as well. In this BoF, we'll begin with a whirlwind tour of the tools we ourselves use, identifying the problems they solve and how well, then quickly open the floor to everyone to share their favorites as well. Along the way, we'll jot down every tool mentioned and share the results. With educational technology an evergreen landscape, this year's list will surely be different from last! Attendees should exit this session with a better understanding of the current landscape, familiarized with innovations they can bring back to their own classes (whether high school, undergraduate, or graduate), without reinventing wheels themselves.","David","J.","Malan","malan@harvard.edu","","Harvard University","Cambridge","MA","USA"

"PT","b781","Strategies for Authentic Assessments of Mastery in CS Courses","","0","Assessing student mastery is an increasingly important aspect of a computer science (CS) course. Recent discussions in the SIGCSE community have questioned traditional assessment and grading practices, such as the use of high-stakes exams and standardized programming assignments. As an alternative, authentic assessments of mastery have been proposed with the goal of creating more equitable and inclusive classrooms that support a diversity in student discourses and epistemologies. This Birds-of-a-Feather session will provide a forum for conversations around assessment of student mastery. Although conversations will likely draw on experiences from teaching remote courses, the discussions can also inspire assessment ideas and methods that work for in-person instruction as well. The discussion leaders will begin by sharing their experiences using formative, low-stakes quizzes; two-stage individual and group assessments; student-generated video problem solutions; written research papers; and creative projects. For each assessment, the discussion leaders expect to address questions such as: What were the goals? What classes was it used in? How did we grade it? How does it scale? This session is a space for participants to expand our collective understanding of how authentic assessments can be used in CS courses and share ideas to inform research and practice toward grading for equity. Afterward, discussion notes will be compiled and publicly archived at https://kevinl.info/authentic-assessments","Kevin","","Lin","kevinl@cs.uw.edu","Paul G.

"PT","b787","How Can Computer Science Educators Benefit from Data Science Education?","","0","Data science in an emerging interdisciplinary field integrating knowledge and skills from computer science, statistics, and an application domain. The contribution of computer science education to the field of data science education is therefore evident. As computer science educators, however, we can benefit from adapting concepts and methods of data science education as well. For example, working with real data sets, a common practice in data science education, can benefit computer science students, giving them better sense of real-life problems; Statistical thinking, a fundamental thinking skill for data scientists, can enhance computational thinking as a real-life problem-solving skill.
This BOF will provide a platform to discuss both the possible benefits computer science educators can earn from the emerging field of data science education and practical pedagogical methods to achieve these benefits.

"PT","b788","Using Validated Assessments to Learn About Your Students","","1","Computer Science now has a number of validated instruments available for measuring student knowledge or interest in computing including the Second CS1 Assessment (SCS1), The Basic Data Structures Inventory (BDSI), the Computing Attitudes Survey (CAS), and the Digital Logic CI.  These instruments can be used by instructors to assess their students and/or their own teaching.  They can also be used by researchers to measure students? learning or attitudes.  The goal of this BOF is to help instructors and researchers gain a better understanding of how to use these instruments, whether that be to get started in education research, to compare student learning across terms/curricular revisions, or just to learn more about student misconceptions.  We will begin by discussing the available instruments, their purpose, and how to obtain them.  Then we will open the discussion to the group on what they would like to measure, how these instruments might work for them, and how to best employ them with their students.","Michael","","Clancy","clancy@cs.berkeley.edu","","University of California, Berkeley","Berkeley","CA","USA"

We invite genuine and honest conversations about the challenges facing rising academics and professionals in this area. We have three goals: (1) to foster a community of support among CSEd grad students, (2) to connect students with new opportunities and ways of thinking about CSEd, and (3) to cultivate mentorship among participants to send them off with potential collaborators, supporters and advocates.","Jean","","Salac","salac@uchicago.edu","","University of Chicago","Chicago","IL","USA"

"PT","b810","Community Colleges: Increasing Participation at SIGCSE and ACM Activities","","1","Community and technical colleges play a significant role in computing education by offering associate-degrees in a variety of ACM-recognized disciplines to a diverse student population.  The ACM Committee for Computing Education in Community Colleges (CCECC), a standing committee of the ACM Education Board, serves and supports community and technical college educators in all aspects of computing education, including curriculum and assessment development, advising on public policy and advocating for community and technical colleges throughout the world.

The ACM CCECC has seen a growing need and interest to increase community college participation in ACM conferences, SIGs, and related activities. For example. community college educators are looking for avenues to identify funding opportunities for professional development and conferences; facilitate collaboration on grants and projects; and actively participate in webinars and informal discussions on topics tailored to community college computing educators. This Birds-of-a-Feather session will bring together those interested in community college computing education and open a dialog to identify and discuss unique issues of interest for this community. Discussion is open to topics across all computing disciplines to support community college educators and ultimately help increase their participation in SIGCSE and ACM activities.

"PT","b819","Engaging Students in Open Source&#58; Opportunities and Approaches","","0","Recently, many faculty have begun to engage students in free and open source software (FOSS) development both for pedagogical advantage and in response to increased student demand. Faculty see FOSS as providing authentic computing artifacts to enrich course content. Students see FOSS projects as a way to contribute to something real and  develop their skills while building a portfolio of their work to share with potential employers. Despite these benefits, CS teachers and students have expressed frustration with the challenges of engaging with existing FOSS projects.

This BOF will provide a forum for faculty and members of FOSS communities to exchange ideas and methods for engaging students in FOSS, including what did and did not work.  The kinds of questions that often arise include whether to let students choose their own projects or select projects for them, and whether to establish mentoring relationships with the project community in advance, or to let students develop these relationships for themselves. Other questions often heard are whether to let students form their own work groups, assign the groups, or if students may work by themselves on a project. Conversely, there are FOSS projects that have questions on how to best engage qualified students.  Participant input collected initially will be used to prioritize among the questions above.","Stewart","N.","Weiss","stewart.weiss@hunter.cuny.edu","","Hunter College of the City University of New York","New York","NY","USA"
"PT","b822","Canvas Considered Helpful?","","0","Canvas is one of the most widely used Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and, due to the pandemic, has become one of the primary tools many students use to access course content. Canvas provides everything that one would expect in a modern LMS: the ability to host and organize content; create, manage and grade assignments and quizzes; communicate via discussion boards and announcements; and integrate with external tools. But the devil is in the details, and Canvas suffers from significant shortcomings, some particular to computing courses, others that impede large course management and efficient instructor workflows. Participants in this BOF will share their successes, frustrations, failures, and workarounds using Canvas in computing courses. In the spirit of common commiseration, each participant will be welcome to highlight one ""Canvas gripe"", such as a specific example of poor usability or missing feature. (In the interest of time there's a limit of one gripe per person!)

In recent years, standards and a national framework have delineated universal learning student outcomes in K-12 computer science (CS) education, but there has been less focus and coherence on what is required of teachers to prepare their students to equitably meet these learning outcomes. The 2020 CSTA Standards for CS Teachers were designed to meet this need. In this BoF session, we will provide a platform to discuss the evidence base aligned to each of the five teacher standards: (1) CS Content Knowledge and Skills, (2) Equity and Inclusion, (3) Professional Growth and Identity, (4) Instructional Design, and (5) Classroom Practice. Participants will share their knowledge and experience in a facilitated conversation organized around focal questions for each standard.","Bryan","","Twarek","bryan.twarek@csteachers.org","","Computer Science Teachers Association","Chicago","IL","USA"

"PT","b827","Departmental Cultures of Inclusion","","0","As computer science programs experience booming enrollments, departmental priorities for educating all students are shifting. Nurturing a departmental culture that promotes inclusion when resources and space are scarce can be difficult. As a Birds of a Feather session, the facilitators will lead participants in a discussion of practices that support inclusion at the departmental and classroom levels. We focus on ways that faculty and departments can prepare and implement inclusive practices and policies that support the ideas that all students can learn and belong, and that ability is not fixed, but malleable. We will also discuss how departmental efforts can be documented and measured for effectiveness. While evaluation is always important, departments impacted by new BPC requirements piloted by the NSF to measure departmental changes to support equity (see https://www.nsf.gov/cise/bpc/White_Paper.pdf ) may be particularly interested. Participants will form small guided discussion groups with one BOF facilitator in each group. Groups will be provided centering questions and artifacts to guide their discussion. Participants will reconvene to report out across groups. The BOF is appropriate for computing educators who are focusing on?or developing--departmental practices that support the success of all learners, with an emphasis on underrepresented and underserved groups. It is also appropriate for educational researchers who emphasize department and classroom level research related to growth mindset, asset-based pedagogy, culturally relevant pedagogy, and inclusion

However, the COVID-19 pandemic and the switch to remote teaching introduces new difficulties to teaching a subject that many already find challenging. This BOF provides a forum for computing educators to discuss strategies they have used to teach PDC remotely. The organizers will share techniques that they have found effective (including the different tradeoffs those techniques involve) and foster a discussion in which others can share novel ways of teaching PDC remotely. The end-goals are: (i) to provide a venue in which those who have taught PDC remotely can share their experiences, in the hopes of identifying best practices; and (ii) to enable participants who are new to PDC to learn from the experiences of faculty who have already taught such courses in this new environment. No laptop required; any materials resulting from this session will be distributed via CSinParallel.org.","Joel","C","Adams","adams@calvin.edu","Computer Science","Calvin University","Grand Rapids","MI","USA"

"PT","b840","Best Practices for Designing and Implementing NSF S-STEM Scholarship Projects","","1","This Birds-of-a-Feather session is for anyone interested in the NSF Scholarships in STEM (S-STEM) program, including current and former Principal Investigators (PIs) and those planning to apply. The S-STEM program funds scholarships and student support activities to support low-income, academically talented students in STEM. Any institution of higher education may apply for S-STEM funding, and a variety of projects are supported by the program. Designing and implementing a successful S-STEM project poses many challenges. The goal of this session is to catalyze a community of practice for S-STEM PIs. It will provide an opportunity to discuss lessons learned and best practices for writing S-STEM proposals, navigating the logistics of project implementation, and ensuring students have the support they need to be successful. Specific topics to be discussed include the following: (1) Understanding the solicitation requirements and common proposal mistakes; (2) Scholar recruitment and data-driven approaches for selection; (3) Cohort building including design of cohort-based activities for students from different majors or class years and strategies for integrating new students into an existing cohort; and (4) Remediation strategies including proactive interventions and peer support. The session leaders will introduce each topic; participants will then be invited to join a breakout group discussion of one of the topics. Lastly, participants will be invited to continue discussing S-STEM after SIGCSE by joining a Slack workspace dedicated to S-STEM best practices and lessons.","Sami","","Rollins","srollins@cs.usfca.edu","","University of San Francisco","San Francisco","CA","USA"

"PT","b842","Creating, Building, and Sustaining Community in CS Departments","","0","Broadening participation in Computer Science requires supporting individuals by helping them feel a sense of belonging to a larger community. In this BOF, we invite participants to brainstorm, to share strategies, and to explore possibilities for building and supporting intentional communities, particularly for underrepresented or marginalized groups.  Whether these communities are spaces created by faculty for faculty, by students for students, or by faculty for students, we need to be thoughtful and deliberate about the ways in which we set up, build, and maintain supportive relationships.  Indeed, we now increasingly need techniques and strategies that will work both virtually and in person and that can be sustained by both live and asynchronous discussions.  During this virtual session, we invite you to grab a snack and a cup of tea and join us as we setup our own ?SIGCSE CommuniTEA? with the intention of supporting each other as we collectively work towards helping all individuals truly feel that CS is for them and towards increasing that sense of belonging to both smaller and larger computer science communities.

This experience, while an individual one, consists of many concerns that are shared amongst these transitioning students. Partly as a result of these concerns, retention rates of first year Computer Science students suffer. These topics were discussed and analysed at length in various studies, panels and working groups to create an initial body of understanding, influenced by a number of institutions across the world. However, the recent and unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has caused further disruption: it is likely that students transitioning into higher education during the pandemic were faced with unparalleled concerns, anxieties and stresses.","Mark","","Zarb","m.zarb@rgu.ac.uk","","Robert Gordon University","Aberdeen","","United Kingdom"

"PT","b853","Supporting Computer Science Student Mental Health through Unprecedented Times","","1","Long hours, lacking a sense of belonging, and fear of failure are just some of the stressors that affect Computer Science students and professionals alike, leading to burnout, anxiety, and depression. Although this issue is not unique to the field of computing, there is significant need for awareness and support around student mental health in the CS education community. However, while many CS educators recognize the importance of supporting their students? mental health, many feel ill-equipped to do so, are unsure if their approaches are helpful, and seek a community of educators with whom they can share ideas. Of particular concern is the mental health of students in underrepresented and marginalized groups within CS, particularly women, first-generation/low-income students, and members of the BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities, as they struggle to cope with the unprecedented events of 2020, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the worldwide protests against systemic racial injustice, and the US Presidential election, all while participating in challenging academic courses. In this timely and important session, participants will have an opportunity to discuss the mental health issues that affect CS students, share resources that are available to students and educators, and describe their efforts to create and foster a culture of understanding and support for student mental health within their communities.

More and more programs are attempting to create sustainable and beneficial positions for student instructors as a way to handle current teaching needs as well as develop the next wave of teaching-track faculty. This BOF will enable a discussion of the why and how programs choose to engage students as instructors, including challenges, best practices, lessons learned, and tips for starting such a program. The discussion leaders can offer perspectives from differing approaches including student population (undergraduate vs. graduate), teaching context (summer vs. non-summer term, solo vs. shared teaching models), and support structures (administrative, mentorship, training) and will have former student teachers from their institutions participate in the small group discussions to reflect upon their experiences.","Justin","","Hsia","jhsia@cs.washington.edu","","University of Washington","Seattle","WA","USA"

This necessary paradigm shift has allowed many educators to take a critical look at their teaching styles, and to use technology in innovative ways to create the best experience for their students. Computing is a subject which traditionally, focuses on experiential, in-person activities such as labs, groupwork, and tutorials. COVID-19 has forced educators to reconsider the use of time and catalyzed overnight innovation. Some of these new practices are ones that would be valuable to learn from and carry forward into our post-COVID teaching. This BoF will provide a platform for discussion of what the post- COVID academic landscape might look like, and how we can use lessons learned during this educational shift to improve our practice.","Angela","","Siegel","siegel@dal.ca","","Dalhousie University","Halifax","NS","Canada"

"PT","b866","One Semicolon Away from Success&#58; Rebranding &#34;failure&#34; in CS1 through New Terminology","","0","In a review of student programming work (through playback of their submissions via online IDE), it was noted that students could be quite close to a successful solution and repeatedly start over, deleting all of the work done to that point in time. The words of Thomas Edison expressed the problem associated with this current branding: ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won?t work."" While this is meant to imply that failure has led towards success, the idea that something ""won't work"" captures the mindset that students are facing when using the word ?failure? in regards to programming. In fact, iterations of programs move students incrementally closer to their goal. The notion of a binary concept like pass/fail being applied to programming leaves less room for creativity and exploration. Amongst new programming students, after reaching this point of 'passing', student fear of modifying and 'playing' with working programs has been noted. In order to address the concerns of students and help shift student mindsets away from 'failure' towards 'incremental improvement', a rebranding exercise must take place.","Angela","","Siegel","siegel@dal.ca","","Dalhousie University","Halifax","NS","Canada"

We discuss how deliberate reflection can be integrated into coursework and how instructors can embed it. We will use an online problem solving activity individually and in small groups to provide a context for reflection, and practice guided reflection as problem solvers (emulating students) and as instructors. Discussion leaders will guide reflective discussions and connect to their experiences teaching problem solving courses. Collaborative problem solving and reflection activities can support the participation and success of all students across academic content areas, specifically underrepresented students. This session expects to engage educators interested in reflection to increase students? critical thinking skills. Leaders are CS faculty who taught CAHSI INCLUDES problem solving courses, designed in collaboration with Google, with reflection as an important part of solving problems. We will utilize a problem-solving activity to ground discussions in a shared experience, with time for solitary work, group work, and reflection on the problem and the processes used to solve it. Discussion leaders will guide reflective discussion and connect to their experiences teaching problem solving course content as part of the Google/CAHSI partnership.

"PT","b871","Jupyter for Teaching Data Science","","1","A recent evolution of cloud-based tools creates an easy and powerful way for students to access the industry standard data science tools from within a browser window. Jupyter notebooks were originally developed for sharing of scientific results and reproducible open science. However, when delivered through a cloud-based server, they have huge benefits for teaching, including removing the need to install any software locally or require any specific machine to be used by students. UC Berkeley has extensive experience teaching via Jupyter, including the popular introductory Data 8 course, small Data Science Modules in non- Data Science classes, and advanced work in the Data 100 and Data 102 ( Machine Learning) classes. There is a library of OER curricular materials to share between institutions. In addition, Multiple languages and interfaces can be served, from Jupyter in multiple languages, Rstudio, and even a Linux desktop, as well as auto-grading approaches. We are interested to share experiences across institutions utilizing this approach. 
The use of teaching Jupyterhubs to date, both for introductory to Data Science courses, as well as more advanced topics is growing rapidly. We would like to have a conversation about how to use Jupyterhubs and teaching Jupyter notebooks from a variety of instructors and institutions. We are also interested in how to provide these types of resources to additional educational settings who may be more resource constrained.","Eric","","Van Dusen","ericvd@berkeley.edu","Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society","University of California, Berkeley","Berkeley","CA","USA"

AI techniques are expected to enhance cybersecurity by assisting human system managers with automated monitoring, analysis, and responses to cybersecurity attacks. Conversely, it is essential to guard AI technologies from unintended uses and hostile exploitation by leveraging cybersecurity practices. Research results at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity can help us to be better equipped with tools and techniques to tackle the growing cybersecurity challenges, while also presenting an opportunity to devise fundamentally new ways to motivate and educate students about cybersecurity in the age of AI. Likewise, a June 2019 technical workshop on ?Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity: Opportunities and Challenges? noted how the interplay between AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity will continue to introduce new opportunities and challenges in the security of AI as well as AI for cybersecurity. Basic research at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and education has the potential to expand existing AI opportunities and resources in cybersecurity education and workforce development. Education efforts are needed to foster workforce knowledge and skills about applying AI expertise to cybersecurity as well as building robust and trustworthy AI. This BOF session will bring together researchers who are interested in these collaborative explorations.","Nigamanth","","Sridhar","nsridhar@nsf.gov","","National Science Foundation","Alexandria","VA","USA"

One area that has not been explored in-depth is the use of concurrent enrollment (CE) programs to expand access to high school CS courses such as CS Principles or CS1. CE courses are those that are taught by an approved teacher in a high school. Unlike other programs that offer credit by exams (e.g., College Board?s Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate), the context for concurrent enrollment varies with state and insitutional policies. However, CE programs also hold potential for broadening participation in computing with flexibility in timelines and assessments in alignment with local school contexts. We will facilitate discussion around what it takes to develop a CS CE program including teacher qualifications, aligning courses to majors or other college requirements, partnering with high schools, assessment standards, etc. CE programs also have the potential to support departmental Broadening Participation in Computing plans.

In a networked IT world where transactions are conducted through extensive use of the internet, cybersecurity has become integral with information security. Security is one of the most exciting computing fields [1], since it has something that no other computer science field has, an adversary. The same element also makes it one of the most challenging fields because of the unpredictability and the creativity/imagination required. The dearth of faculty who can teach the theory and practice of security is a serious impediment to offering formal education in this domain. While virtual world environments, game-based learning, cyberwars, and other learning-focused interactions have the potential to introduce security concepts and thinking skills in an engaging way to students and professionals, there is also a need to inculcate a 'security mindset,' [1].

The efforts to bring about greater equity in participation often address issues related to curriculum, educator preparation and professional development, and to a lesser extent, school systems and structures. Furthermore, issues related to broadening participation such as what populations we consider, how disenfranchised populations fare, and their rates of retention and achievement within CS education programs are central to equitable computing and the aspirational goals of CSforAll. While the goals of broadening participation are admirable, the 2020 State of CS Education (Code.org, CSTA, & ECEP Alliance, 2020) report makes it clear that equitable CS education is a distant shore. The purpose of this BoF session is to create a space: (a) to explore current research and policy efforts towards equitable CS education and their efficacy, and (b) to interrogate the tensions that underlie these efforts and the practical implications of the current research agenda for K-12 teachers and students.","Bryan","","Twarek","bryan.twarek@csteachers.org","","Computer Science Teachers Association","Chicago","IL","USA"

These challenges can result in degraded project outcomes, as commonly observed in programming-intensive mid-level CS courses. We have previously found that success in these situations is associated with a disciplined personal software process. Procrastination is a prominent failure of self-regulation that can occur for a number of reasons, e.g., low expectancy of success, low perceived value of the task at hand, or decision-paralysis regarding how to begin when faced with a large task. It is pervasive, but may be addressed through targeted interventions. We draw on theory related to goal theory and problem-solving in engineering education to evaluate the value of explicit <i>project milestones</i> at curbing procrastination and its negative impacts on relatively long-running software projects. We conduct a quasi-experiment in which we study differences in project and course outcomes between students in a treatment (with milestones) and control group (without milestones). We found that students in the treatment group were more likely to finish their projects on time, produced projects with higher correctness, and finished the course with generally better outcomes. Within the treatment group, we found that students who completed more milestones saw better outcomes than those who completed fewer milestones. We found no differences in withdrawal or failure rates between the treatment and control groups. An end-of-term survey indicated that student perceptions of the milestones were overwhelmingly positive.","Clifford","A.","Shaffer","shaffer@vt.edu","","Virginia Tech","Blacksburg","VA","USA"

Understanding what SRL struggles students face in programming assignments is critical to guide many efforts in computing education, such as designing scalable interventions and developing effective learning technologies. Prior studies on this topic contributed to understanding what SRL strategies CS students typically use in programming assignments, and the interventions for some SRL struggles such as procrastination. However, few studies have investigated student SRL struggles in programming systematically. To fill this gap, we investigate student SRL struggles in the context of CS2 through a case study. We used multiple approaches to collect real-time data and validate our findings, such as tracking student progress, identifying potential SRL struggles, and interviewing identified struggling students to confirm our identifications. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of what SRL struggles students face in programming at a fine-grained level, and provides guidance on interventions for SRL struggles.","Kai","","Arakawa","hicksk5@wwu.edu","","Western Washington University","Bellingham","WA","USA"

However, analyzing program structure by hand is time-consuming, and teachers need better tools for computer-assisted exploration of student solutions. As a first step towards an education-oriented program analysis toolkit, we show how supervised machine learning methods can automatically classify student programs into a predetermined set of high-level structures. We evaluate two models on classifying student solutions to the Rainfall problem: a nearest-neighbors classifier using syntax tree edit distance and a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that these models can achieve 91\% classification accuracy when trained on 108 programs. We further explore the generality, trade-offs, and failure cases of each model.","Will","","Crichton","wcrichto@cs.stanford.edu","","Stanford University","Stanford","CA","USA"

In this study, we investigated the video-watching behavior of students in a flipped CS1  programming course (n=490).   We computed three behavioral metrics related to video watching: percentage of the videos watched, the number of times a video was opened to be watched, and when a video is watched with respect to the due date.  We used k-medoids clustering on these metrics finding two distinct groups: 1) Low Video Engagement Group (53% of the students) watched 12% of the videos and 2) High Video Engagement Group (47% of the students) watched 75% of the videos.  Analysis of these two different groups of engagement showed that students with prior programming experience watch fewer videos.  We also found that students that watch more videos perform slightly better on summative assessments in the course. We discuss how regular video watching can be a key learning strategy for some but not all students in a flipped CS1 course, where some students can achieve good learning outcomes with minimal watching of the course videos.","Colin","","Moore","camoore7@ncsu.edu","","North Carolina State University","Raleigh","NC","USA"

Yet, as the influence of these fields reach farther into daily life, the disparate impacts of these algorithms and models on more marginalized populations have also begun to surface rapidly. To address this emerging crisis, it is necessary to equip the next generation of computer scientists with the ethical tools needed to tackle these issues. Thus, an exploratory study was conducted to investigate how students who are currently enrolled in computing-related programs evaluate and understand the ethical and social impact of technology. 43 students in computing majors were presented with 5 scenarios of different technologies that utilizes machine learning to address potentially sensitive areas (e.g. policing, medical diagnosing). The long-format responses to these scenarios were qualitatively analyzed. Additionally, quantitative analysis was conducted after qualitatively coding the long-format responses into four sentiments. Ultimately, we found that participants were able to decipher the social implications of technology. However, many issues of systemic discrimination were missing from participants' analysis. Alarmingly, our findings also indicated that 50% or more of participants were not exposed to most of the technologies highlighted in the scenarios, which highlights a potential gap in computing curriculum of connecting ethics as well as racial, cultural, and socioeconomic understanding to computer science. Based on these results, we suggest that computing-related curriculum be reevaluated with ethical training in mind.

This raises significant challenges for assessing student work and measuring the impact of pedagogical interventions:  What do we measure and how, when each team is working on a different project?  To address this question, we present a collection of metrics developed using the Goal-Question-Metric framework from the empirical software engineering literature, and an empirical study in which we applied those metrics to assess 23 team software projects involving 94 students at three institutions. Study results suggest that these metrics, which gauge commit, issue, and overall product quality, are sensitive to differences in the quality of teams? processes and products.

We present a qualitative thematic analysis of the mentoring practices used in an inclusive, structured computer science research program targeting second-year undergraduates across two large public research universities in the United States.  Uniquely in this program, students had two mentoring sources: a technical mentor for each research group and a graduate student mentor common to all groups.  We analyzed reflections on mentoring from 64 undergraduate researchers at two points in the program. We compared the roles of the two mentors, characterized students' perceptions of both successful and unsuccessful mentors, and examined how mentoring relationships evolved. Generally, students valued mentors who provided project guidance or technical support and who were perceived to be friendly. We found that the roles of the two mentors were complementary in sometimes surprising ways. Overall, our analysis confirms prior work on undergraduate research mentoring, and provides new insights into the unique benefits of a dual-mentoring approach and how to best support early undergraduate computing researchers.","Christine","","Alvarado","cjalvarado@eng.ucsd.edu","","University of California, San Diego","La Jolla","CA","USA"

We had students demonstrate their metacognitive monitoring skills by predicting their scores for all three exams of a 15-week CS1 course. We collected data from two course offerings. Moreover, we had students predict both before and after each exam to understand the effect of seeing it and surveyed students on how they studied.

We found that our study's students were reasonably accurate, but low performers were worse than high performers. However, high performers did not improve between their before and after predictions. We did not have sufficient evidence that students improve their predictions over time. Prediction accuracy did not have a gender effect.

The Inchworm is a holistic low stakes assessment of those three skills that provides insights on students' use of abstraction in problem solving while exposing the intricacies of code design.
  We tested this task with three cohorts of undergraduate students that have passed our core CS2 course.  Most of them solved it in their first attempt, showing a reasonable mastery of basic algorithmic skills.  In regards to problem solving strategies, most students chose to simulate the process described in the problem, step by step, with less than 10% choosing the more efficient mathematical approach. Their simulations used 4 different modelling strategies, all correct but with varying abstraction and efficiency levels. Simulation designs with poor performance indicate possible gaps in software development skills by disregarding the memory and computational cost of their solutions.","Cruz","","Izu","cruz.izu@adelaide.edu.au","School of Computer Science","The University of Adelaide","Adelaide","","Australia"

Given this option, this study explores the loop constructs students choose when solving a problem. We asked students from introductory programming courses to write solutions to two tasks that require iteration through array or list objects, analyzing their responses and noting coding constructs that indicate a loop-by-value strategy or a loop-by-index strategy. Consistent with previous accounts, we find that students may employ a strategy based on their experience and the required task. However, they often implement the strategy using code elements that are inconsistent with the chosen strategy, including referencing the index when a reference to the value at the location of the index is required. Some inconsistencies, such as the use of misleading variable names, do not affect program execution but often coincide with other inconsistencies that produce incorrect code. We recommend that instructors provide explicit scaffolding for the sequential introduction of iterative constructs. We note that a discussion of when each type of loop is typically used may be insufficient and suggest reinforcing habits for maintaining and checking consistency of looping strategies.","Craig","S.","Miller","cmiller@cdm.depaul.edu","","DePaul University","Chicago","IL","USA"

This renewed interest created an uptick of enrollment in computer science courses. Increased number of students search for information about CS courses and professors. Often times, students turn to a professor's profile on online sites, e.g. RateMyProfessor.com (RMP), to read feedback and assessments made by other students. Student Evaluations of Teaching (SETs), conducted online or on paper, are widely used to assess and improve the teaching quality of professors, and to provide critical assessment of the teaching material and content. This paper studies the role of race and gender of computer science professors on their teaching evaluation by analyzing the publicly available data of over 39,000 CS professors on RateMyProfessor. We found that women are generally rated lower then men in overall teaching quality. They are also perceived lower in personality-related student feedback ratings, i.e. they perceived less humorous, and less inspirational. We also found that Asian professors are perceived to be tough graders and lecture heavy.

Scholars have theorized that institutional approaches to managing these cycles of enrollment growth, notably the inability to scale programs, resulted not only in the discipline's constriction, but also the disproportionate decline in the participation of Black, Latin*, and Indigenous students in computing. This history suggests that it is important for stakeholders to think intentionally about how the management of enrollment surges can hamper, or even undermine, efforts to broaden participation in CS; yet there is limited research examining whether and how stakeholders from CS departments perceive this relationship. This paper reports findings from a qualitative study of CS departments at four public research institutions in the United States to understand how 55 stakeholders perceived undergraduate enrollment and diversity trends, as well as the relationship between booming enrollments and diversity efforts within the department. We found that participants largely spoke about their diversity work without referencing the impacts of enrollment shifts in the department. When this relationship was discussed, participants varied in how they framed it?as either positive, negative, or null. We argue that separating out diversity work from core priorities in the department will hinder departments? ability to sustain BPC efforts into the future. Instead, it is imperative that stakeholders understand how departmental responses to dynamic external forces (e.g., booming enrollments, shifting realities related to COVID-19) impact diversity efforts.","Kathleen","J.","Lehman","kate.j.lehman@gmail.com","","University of California, Los Angeles","Los Angeles","CA","USA"

Current digital era calls for digital professionals. Countless applicants apply to study Computer Science (CS) and Information Technology (IT) each year worldwide. Thousands of them are left without the university place they aspire to. At the same time, these disciplines suffer from numerous dropouts.</par><par><b>Objective:</b> Could performance and persistence in CS and IT higher education be fostered by more accurate acceptance criteria? Academic studies on skills assessed in entrance examinations along with their predictive power were systematically reviewed in this study to ultimately propose evidence based student selection criteria for the discipline.</par><par><b>Methods:</b> Scoping review gathered peer-reviewed studies from four academic databases. Their findings on skills assessed in entrance examinations and their predictive value were extracted and synthesized. The results were evaluated in a national consultation round utilizing the Delphi method.</par><par><b>Findings:</b> The review discovered seven skill categories assessed in CS and IT entrance examinations. However, the predictive values of these skills were contradictory. The Delphi process agreed on reasoning skills, verbal skills and mathematics as the most important skills to be assessed in the reformed national entrance examination. </par><par><b>Discussion:</b> The skills studied were usually limited to mathematics and verbal skills. Reasoning and problem solving skills were seldom examined separately. Critical thinking skills were not mentioned in any of the articles reviewed.

To make CS more inclusive, we can train computer science (CS) teaching assistants (TAs) to create inclusive classrooms. The Teaching Practices Game is a scenario-based card game meant to prepare CS TAs for difficult situations they may encounter and help them promote diversity and inclusion. Game participants (N=86) were surveyed from multiple institutions. The majority of survey respondents (N=86) agreed or strongly agreed that the game taught them new strategies for responding to difficult teaching situations (83%) and for discussing diversity and inclusion (69%). Additionally, respondents reported that the game made them more confident (74%) and more likely (66%) to respond to biased statements. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that there were small and statistically insignificant differences in enjoyment, learning, or likelihood of response to biased statements between participants who do and do not identify as underrepresented in CS. A primary contribution of the research is a review of professional development practices and diversity training strategies that can inform the training of TAs, and we discuss the extent to which best practices from previous research were incorporated in the game.

This is a significant problem as debugging is an activity that is a key component of software development and a frustrating and time-consuming barrier to students who are learning to program.  In this paper we reflect on teaching and learning debugging through the lens of student beliefs about their own debugging practice.  We find that few students use systematic approaches such as the scientific method of hypothesis generation and testing that is informally adopted by many software developers. Some students appeared to be satisfied with their ad hoc approaches while others expressed a desire to develop more thorough approaches.","Jacqueline","","Whalley","jwhalley@aut.ac.nz","","Auckland University of Technology","Auckland","","New Zealand"

To explore what options exist, we sought to develop a better understanding of the researchers and institutions currently working in CSEd. We collected publication data between 2015 and 2020 from the Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE) and ACM International Computing Education Research (ICER) conferences, and from the ACM Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE) journal. Using a total of 1,099 publications, we analyzed the authorship blocks and their affiliations. We created a comprehensive database, used for analysis on recent contributions to CSEd research. Among other findings, we observed that 2,068 distinct authors contributed, spanning 578 global institutions. From these, 963 of the authors came from 236 distinct universities in the United States. Moreover, we found that most often, new growth from international contributions resulted from the participation of additional universities, whereas in the United States most growth was the result of new contributors from the same universities. The results of this research are intended to encourage global collaborations, to provide an informative guide about recent publications in the field, and also to serve as a guidepost for graduate recruitment and further exploration into CSEd research and programs.","Stephanie","","Lunn","slunn002@fiu.edu","","Florida International University","Miami","FL","USA"

To support the kinds of computer science curriculum and instruction that makes this possible, there is an urgent need to develop and validate computational thinking (CT) assessments for elementary-aged students. We developed the Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students (ACES) to measure the CT concepts of loops and sequences for students in grades 3-5. The ACES includes block-based coding questions as well as non-programming, Bebras-style questions. We conducted cognitive interviews to understand student perspectives while taking the ACES. We piloted the assessment with 57 4th grade students who had completed a CT curriculum. Preliminary analyses indicate acceptable reliability and appropriate difficulty and discrimination among assessment items. The significance of this paper is to present a new CT measure for upper elementary students and to share its intentional development process.","Miranda","C.","Parker","miranda.parker@uci.edu","","University of California, Irvine","Irvine","CA","USA"

In a cross-reviewing learning/exercise environment, however, beginners often cannot provide useful feedback and viewpoints to others. One of the reasons for this is that beginners are not confident in their understanding of the software design models. These learners should be encouraged by strengthening their understanding of the models. In this research, we propose a self-review supporting environment that provides learners with feedback generated by translating their Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams into natural language descriptions. This enables beginners to recognize discrepancies between what they would like to describe in their class diagrams and what they actually describe in their class diagrams by comparing them in natural language. We designed three types of templates to make learners aware of the discrepancies. Moreover, we performed an experiment to evaluate whether the feedback produced by translating a learner's model into natural language can support the learner to detect errors in the model themselves, and whether this feedback can support the learner to correct errors in the model themselves. The results of the experiment indicated that the subjects detected errors in their class diagrams with 89.2% accuracy and detected 47.3% of all errors in their diagrams. Furthermore, the subjects corrected the errors they correctly detected with 78.6% accuracy.","Yasuhiro","","Noguchi","noguchi@inf.shizuoka.ac.jp","Faculty of Informatics","Shizuoka Univeristy","Hamamatsu","","Japan"

This cross-case study investigated the school-wide integration of CT in three elementary schools in a large urban school district in the Northeast that has a district-led CS for All initiative. Data included interviews with teachers, professional development providers, and school administrators as well as surveys from teachers and classroom observations in each participating school. Findings revealed three distinct approaches to integration: (a) single teacher leader-driven model, (b) scaffolded professional development model, and (c) intensive coaching model. These approaches reflect the visions set by administrators and teachers, methods used by professional development providers, and cultures of each school. Across the case studies, common pedagogical approaches included strategic use of both unplugged and plugged activities with a range of computational tools, a focus on collaborative project-based learning, and the use of CT-specific academic language to anchor new CT learning within the academic disciplines. The study highlighted advantages and challenges within each integration approach with implications for schools considering CT integration.","Heather","","Sherwood","HSherwood@edc.org","","Education Development Center","New York","NY","USA"

The COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges for students who were already subject to the digital divide, as in-person camps came to a halt if they weren't prepared to pivot. In response, we created a virtual summer camp that provides informal computer science learning opportunities that were intentionally designed to increase the confidence of Black and Latina girls in computing and to promote positive perceptions of computer science education and career opportunities. Key to our approach is the recognition that representation in the camp's community of attendees, teachers, guest speakers, and in the content can foster confidence for Black and Latina girls in computing. In this paper, we draw on the intersectional computing framework and present the structural, instructional, and curricular design of the virtual program and present initial findings on the impact of the camp on computing confidence, intent to persist, social supports, and computing outcome expectations. Findings of a pre- and post-survey study of 107 camp attendees show that participating in the camp resulted in an increase in computing confidence as well as computing outcome expectations among Black and Latina girls.","Khalia","M.","Braswell","khalia@temple.edu","","Temple University","Philadelphia","PA","USA"

workforce, and computer science programs are faced with the challenges
of engaging and retaining students to meet the growing need in that
sector. However, administrators and instructors often find themselves
either reinventing the wheel or relying too heavily on intuition,
despite the availability of national curriculum standards. To address
these issues, we present CS Materials, an open-source
resource targeted at computing educators for designing and
analyzing courses for coverage of recommended guidelines, and alignment
between the various components within a course, between sections of the
same course, or course sequences within a program.  The system works by
facilitating mapping educational materials to national curriculum standards.

A side effect of the system is that it centralizes the design of the
courses and the materials used therein.  The curriculum guidelines act as a
lingua franca that allows examination of and comparison between materials
and courses. More relevant to instructors, the system enables a more precise
search for materials that match particular topics and learning outcomes, and
dissemination of high quality materials and course designs.

This paper discusses the system, and analyzes the costs
and benefits of its features and usage. While adding courses and
materials requires some overhead, having a centralized repository of
courses and materials with a shared structure and vocabulary serves
students, instructors, and administrators, by promoting a data-driven approach to rigor
and alignment with national standards.","Alec","","Goncharow","agoncha1@uncc.edu","Computer Science","University of North Carolina at Charlotte","Charlotte","NC","USA"

We present the results of a study of 162 undergraduate participants tasked with comprehending iterative, recursive, and tail-recursive versions of CS1 functions. First, we carry out a task-specific analysis, finding that students perform significantly better on the iterative framings of two problems with non-branching numerical computation and significantly better on the recursive framing of another that involves array classification (p <= 0.036). 

Second, we investigate differences in the most common student mistakes by program framing. We find that students were more likely to produce wrong answers with incorrect types or structures for recursive and tail-recursive program versions.

Finally, we investigated correlations between programming performance and background factors including experience, gender, ethnicity, affluence, and spatial ability. We find that the factors relevant to explaining performance are similar for both iterative and recursive problems. While programming experience is the most significant factor, we find that spatial ability, gender, and ethnicity were more relevant for explaining performance than affluence.

Our findings show that the initiative had a positive impact on participants? AI knowledge, being the enhancement especially important for those learners who initially showed less familiarity with the topic. We observe, for instance, that while previous ideas on AI revolve around the term robot, after the experience they do around solve and problem. Based on these results we suggest that LearningML can be seen as a promising platform for the teaching and learning of AI in K-12 environments.

"PT","cer252","Exploratory Reading Groups&#58; A Scalable Approach to Creative, Relational, and Student-Driven Exploration in CS Education","","7","Most CS education initiatives focus primarily on teaching raw computational skills and domain knowledge. While this is certainly important, it ignores the creative and real-world aspects that are needed for applying skills to societal problems, and for attracting more diverse populations of students. One way to impart this type of learning is through undergraduate research. Unfortunately, these opportunities are limited and hard to scale due to their need for mentorship. In this paper, we introduce exploratory reading groups as a way to support creativity and intrinsic motivation in a scalable manner. In contrast to graduate journal clubs, exploratory reading groups are designed for broad exploration of ideas, and their lightweight, student-driven nature makes them easily scalable. We present design patterns for structuring groups learned over a two-year time period of running and iterating on exploratory reading groups through a user-centered process. This time period saw the program grow from a group of 6 students to having served over 260 students, all participating completely voluntarily. In surveys and interviews of participants, we found that students valued the experience tremendously, but that successful exploration took on diverse meanings. We found that surprisingly strong relational ties developed from a simple intervention, and describe three clusters of participant motivations and experiences that emerged.","Dustin","","Palea","dpalea@ucsc.edu","","University of California, Santa Cruz","Santa Cruz","CA","USA"

Piazza is one such forum that was built specifically for academic institutions, and has been widely adopted. Students have the opportunity to ask questions and seek answers from peers and instructors alike online, allowing them to find the information they need even if they do not know fellow students in the class or if they cannot make an instructor?s office hours. However, recent analysis of the popular online discussion site Stack Overflow, suggests that women are more likely than men to withdraw from such a community if they do not identify other members of the same gender. Women are often a minority in computer science courses and may express difficulty interacting with or seeking help from their peers who are predominantly men. Considering the importance of providing equal access to students regardless of gender and the value of resources like Piazza in one's education, it is imperative to assess the representation and impact of gender on Piazza. We analyzed data from over 2,500 Piazza users across three computer science courses at the University of Virginia and found that women on Piazza post more questions than men, spend more time on the discussion site, and achieve higher reputation scores on average. However, they are more likely than men to both ask and answer questions anonymously and less likely to receive responses from members of the same gender.","Adrian","","Thinnyun","att4wp@virginia.edu","","University of Virginia","Charlottesville","VA","USA"

However, stereotypes and stereotype threat represent a major barrier to underrepresented groups engaging with computer science education. To investigate alternative paths into computational work that sidestep the pressures of stereotypes, we interviewed 22 people working on computational projects in transformative fandom, a community centered on media remix and critique. Our participants--primarily women, people of color, and/or LGBTQ+ people--described a set of stereotypes about computing that prevented them from seeing their own highly technical work as computational. However, participants also described projects that not only taught them computing skills but also opened up alternative pathways for involvement in computer science.

Assessing and addressing item bias is a crucial step in building a validity argument for any assessment instrument. Despite calls for valid assessment tools in CS, item bias is rarely investigated. What kinds of item bias might appear in conventional CS1 exams? To investigate this, we examined responses to a final exam in a large CS1 course. We used differential item functioning (DIF) methods and specifically investigated bias related to binary gender and year of study. Although not a published assessment instrument, the exam had a similar format to many exams in higher education and research: students are asked to trace code and write programs, using paper and pencil. One item with significant DIF was detected on the exam, though the magnitude was negligible. This case study shows how to detect DIF items so that future researchers and practitioners can do these analyses.","Matt","J.","Davidson","mattjd@uw.edu","College of Education","University of Washington","Seattle","WA","USA"

Traditional FLA textbooks are heavy on prose, and homework typically consists of solving many paper exercises. Instructors often make use of Finite State Machine simulators like the JFLAP package. JFLAP allows students to interactively build models and apply different algorithms to these models, providing both a more interactive and a more visual approach. However, course materials have still traditionally relied largely on prose and hand-graded exercises, limiting both the interaction and the amount of practice. In this paper, we propose an eTextbook with integrated tools (simulators and auto-graded exercises) that allow for greater interactivity and levels of engagement. To evaluate the pedagogical effectiveness of our approach, we conducted performance evaluations across different offerings of an FLA course. Results indicate that students using the integrated eTextbook performed better than did a control group using a traditional textbook approach. Students gave positive feedback regarding the usefulness of the auto-graded exercises for practicing different FLA concepts.","Mostafa","","Mohammed","profmdn@vt.edu","Computer Science ","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University &#38; Assiut University","Blacksburg","VA","USA"

In this study, we analyze student perceptions of a syntax-first teaching method. For the first five weeks of a university semester, we assigned students syntax exercises to complete before coming to class. At the end of the semester they were given a prompt asking them to write their thoughts about the exercises.

This case study aimed to understand how teachers make connections between CT and subjects targeted for integration. Epistemological framing contributed new insights on why teachers connected CT in different ways to different subjects: frame shifting focused teachers? attention on goals and activities specific to each subject. As teachers attended to a subject?s particularities, they drew upon different epistemic resources to construct their descriptions of CT. Our participants (n=6) were teachers who taught both 7th-12th grade computing and mathematics as separate subjects. Qualitative coding of interview transcripts revealed that teachers' ideas about CT in computing were strongly influenced by computer programming while their ideas about CT in mathematics corresponded with familiar ways of teaching and learning mathematics. Instead of accepting fragmented notions of CT as the price of integration into individual subjects, we propose limiting the scope when defining CT. We explain how this non-intuitive strategy can preserve the coherence of CT and how it might be used in CT professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers.","Wendy","","Huang","wendy.huang@nie.edu.sg","","National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University","Singapore","","Singapore"

Indeed, with the rapidly growing adoption of digital tools in such courses, the use of various game elements and mechanics to drive participation is increasing. Previous studies on gamification in computing have examined the effects over the whole student population. Prior work in other disciplines has found that the benefits associated with gamification may only be realized for some students, while others may even experience reduced motivation. The Hexad user types survey attempts to tackle this problem by grouping users into six different types for whom gamification should have different effects. The goal is to personalize the game elements for different user types, thus creating gamified experiences more suitable for individual learners. In this work, we study whether the Hexad survey could be used to guide the personalization of gamification in an introductory programming course. Specifically, we examine the quality of students' answers to the Hexad survey and explore whether they can be used to predict students' preferences for enabling gamification in the platform where they complete assignments. In our specific computing education context, we find that classifying students using the Hexad survey does not appear to be an effective approach for the automatic personalization of gamification.","Mitchell","","Rogers","mrog173@aucklanduni.ac.nz","","University of Auckland","Auckland","","New Zealand"

This renders communication and interaction of instructors with individual students extremely challenging, leading to an increase in anonymity (anonymity gap). Especially when students struggle in computing courses, personalized help is crucial for them to overcome their problems and frustration and eventually succeed in their studies. At the same time detecting students' misconceptions and gathering feedback at scale is time consuming, resulting in a lack of unbiased feedback available to course instructors (feedback gap). Real-time student feedback is a crucial source for instructors to adapt their teaching pace, teaching materials, or course content during the course of the semester to cater to an increasingly diverse student population. In this paper, we investigate a scalable approach to collect and analyze student feedback and emotions. We find that sentiment analysis can efficiently capture student emotions, bearing the potential to lessen both the anonymity and feedback gaps.","Marion","","Neumann","m.neumann@wustl.edu","","Washington University in St. Louis","St. Louis","MO","USA"

However, little is known about how elementary students engage in collaborative dialogue for computer science learning. Early findings indicate that these younger students may struggle to manage conflicts that arise during pair programming. To investigate collaborative dialogue that elementary learners use and the conflicts that they encounter, we analyzed videos of twelve pairs of fifth grade students completing pair programming activities. We developed a novel annotation scheme with a focus on collaborative dialogue and conflicts. We found that student pairs used best-practice dialogue moves such as self-explanation, question generation, uptake, and praise in less than 23% of their dialogue. High-conflict pairs antagonized their partner, whereas this behavior was not observed with low-conflict pairs. We also observed more praise (e.g., ""We did it!"") and uptake (e.g., ""Yeah and?"") in low-conflict pairs than high-conflict pairs. All pairs exhibited some conflicts about the task, but high-conflict pairs also engaged in conflicts about control of the computer and their partner?s contributions. The results presented here provide insights into the collaborative process of young learners in CS problem solving, and also hold implications for educators as we move toward building learning environments that support students in this context.","Jennifer","","Tsan","jtsan@ncsu.edu","","North Carolina State University","Raleigh","NC","USA"

These analyses allow us to see what features are important in object-oriented introductory programming languages, which could inform language and tool designers -- and see to what extent the design of these programming tools can have an effect on the way the language is used. We find that many beginners disobey the guidelines that BlueJ promotes, and that patterns of Java use are generally stable over time -- but we do see decreased exception use and a change in target application domains away from GUI programming towards text processing.  We conclude that programming languages for novices could have fewer built-in types but should retain rich libraries.","Pierre","","Weill-Tessier","pierre.weill-tessier@kcl.ac.uk","Department of Informatics","King's College London","London","","United Kingdom"

Caches play a key role in improving performance in modern computing. They are difficult for students to learn, but we have little conceptual or empirical evidence about why. Building on prior frameworks, we propose six underlying knowledge components that we believe students need to robustly evaluate how a cache can affect the performance of code on a processor. We constructed a modular assessment using these components that can be used as a diagnostic instrument to find the concepts students are struggling to understand. Because different institutions teach caches at varying depths of detail, individual modules of the assessment can be used by instructors and researchers as appropriate for their context. We evaluated the assessment using a combination of Classical Test Theory, Exploratory Factor Analysis, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Our results suggest that the assessment is reliable and can be used modularly to assess various components of students' knowledge about caches, though future work needs to be done to evaluate the validity of these modules at different institutions. This assessment can help instructors and researchers design more precisely targeted instructional interventions to help students learn caches. The creation of similar modular assessments may help us in improving instruction in other difficult topics in computing.","Suleman","","Mahmood","msm6@illinois.edu","","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","Urbana","IL","USA"

However, tests may not detect some faults, limiting feedback, and providing inaccurate grades. This issue can be mitigated by first ensuring that tests can detect faults. Mutation analysis is a technique that generates artificial faulty variants of a program for this purpose, called mutants. Mutants that are not detected by tests reveal their inadequacies, providing knowledge on how they can be improved. By using mutants to improve test suites, tutors can gain the confidence that: a) generated grades will not be biased by unidentified faults, and b) students will receive appropriate feedback for their mistakes. Existing work has shown that mutants are suitable substitutes for faults in real world software, but no work has shown that this holds for students' faults. In this paper, we investigate whether mutants are capable of replicating mistakes made by students. We conducted a quantitative study on 197 Java classes written by students across three introductory programming assignments, and mutants generated from the assignments' model solutions. We found that generated mutants capture the observed faulty behaviour of students' solutions. We also found that mutants better assess test adequacy than code coverage in some cases. Our results indicate that tutors can use mutants to identify and remedy deficiencies in grading test suites.","Benjamin","Simon","Clegg","bsclegg1@sheffield.ac.uk","","University of Sheffield","Sheffield","","United Kingdom"

Additionally, particularly in computer-based and online assessment, mitigating cheating efforts is another important consideration. One way to mitigate cheating is by randomly selecting from large pools of equivalent questions.

In order to produce large pools of questions quickly, we used a permutation strategy to rapidly make new question variants by altering existing questions? surface features.

The result is multiple simultaneous pedagogical styles in a single course. In this paper we present the results of comparing six sections of an introductory programming course at the same university, three of which used Scrumage and three of which took a traditional approach. We adminis-tered surveys of both content acquisition and learning atti-tudes at the beginning and end of the course. While students in all sections improved in content learning, the students in the Scrumage classrooms outperformed those in the traditional sections. The improvement in content learning was also more uniformly distributed among students, not limited to the high achievers. Scrumage students showed generally improved atti-tudes about learning after the course, especially in the areas of Effort Regulation (perseverance in problem solving) and Con-trol of Learning (taking responsibility for learning success). We observed some correlation between this metalearning and improvements in content scores in the Scrumage sections, but not in the traditional sections. Finally, based on an analysis of student comments in the Scrumage sections, we show that as the course progressed, positive student comments about their abilities and confidence were more common, even as course material became more difficult.

However, prior work has shown that, in the US's top R1 universities, computer systems courses are not taught with security in mind. It was also shown that students and instructors use unsafe functions in their code, leading to security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we focused on the textbooks used for computer systems courses. We analyzed the discussion of security topics and the use of unsafe functions in the thirteen textbooks used in the top 30 R1 universities in the US for teaching computer systems. We show that many textbooks do not discuss security at all, while some limit their discussion to ``undefined behavior'', ignoring that opportunity to discuss potential security issues associated with the undefined behavior. Furthermore, textbooks that talk about security continue using unsafe functions throughout (though not necessarily in vulnerable ways but also without any warning or explanation).  We also show that many textbooks do not warn about unsafe functions they use or teach how to use them safely.","Majed","","Almansoori","malmansoori2@wisc.edu","","University of Wisconsin-Madison","Madison","WI","USA"

"PT","cer464","A Comparison of Inquiry-Based Conceptual Feedback vs. Traditional Detailed Feedback Mechanisms in Software Testing Education: An Empirical Investigation","","7","The feedback provided by current testing education tools about the deficiencies in a student?s test suite either mimics industry code coverage tools or lists specific instructor test cases that are missing from the student?s test suite.  
While useful in some sense, these types of feedback are akin to revealing the solution to the problem, which can inadvertently encourage students to pursue a trial-and-error approach to testing, rather than using a more systematic approach that encourages learning. 
In addition to not teaching students why their test suite is inadequate, this type of feedback may motivate students to become dependent on the feedback rather than thinking for themselves. 
To address this deficiency, there is an opportunity to investigate alternative feedback mechanisms that include a positive reinforcement of testing concepts. 
We argue that using an inquiry-based learning approach is better than simply providing the answers. 
To facilitate this type of learning, we present Testing Tutor, a web-based assignment submission platform that supports different levels of testing pedagogy via a customizable feedback engine. 
We evaluated the impact of the different types of feedback through an empirical study in two sophomore-level courses. 
We use Testing Tutor to provide students with different types of feedback, either traditional detailed code coverage feedback or inquiry-based learning conceptual feedback, and compare the effects. 
The results show that students that receive conceptual feedback had higher code coverage (by different measures), fewer redundant test cases, and higher programming grades than the students who receive traditional code coverage feedback.","Lucas","","Cordova","cordoval@wou.edu","Division of Computer Science","Western Oregon University","Monmouth","OR","USA"

In response, diversity efforts seek to broaden the participation of underrepresented populations in computing.  This movement towards broadening participation includes blind or visually impaired (BVI) people who, historically, have faced barriers in succeeding in a primarily visually-oriented field. The present literature has examined modifying current tools for greater accessibility for BVI people and developing new, more inclusive learning environments. We argue, however, for additional investigation into the accessibility of computing education from the lens of instructors who teach computing to BVI students. Our paper reports on findings from interviews investigating the learning experience of BVI students in computer science courses from the perspective of teachers of the visually impaired (TVI). We interviewed K12 TVIs regarding their experience teaching students how to code, preparing lectures to accommodate their students' needs, and the resources they believe are necessary to help teachers provide more accessible instruction to the students. Our findings revealed that despite the recent improvements to increase accessibility in K12 computer science curricula, challenges still exist regarding the technology used by BVI students and the lack of accessible learning materials available to teachers. Additionally, our participants offer suggestions of resources to help K12 teachers in providing more accessible instruction to their students. The findings may benefit those interested in improving accessibility in computing education for students with disabilities.","Earl","W.","Huff","earlh@clemson.edu","School of Computing","Clemson University","Clemson","SC","USA"

However, how gamification affects learning and the influence of context-related aspects on that effect demand research to better understand how and to whom gamification enhances programming learning. Therefore, we conducted an experimental study analyzing how gamification worked and the role of context-related aspects in terms of intervention duration and learners' familiarity with programming (i.e., the task's topic). It was a six-week study with 19 undergraduate students from an Algorithms class that measured their learning gains, intrinsic motivation, and number of completed quizzes. Mainly, we found gamification affected learning via intrinsic motivation, effect that depended on intervention duration and learners' familiarity with programming. That is, intrinsic motivation strongly predicted learning gains and gamification's effect on intrinsic motivation changed over time, decreasing from positive to negative as learners had less familiarity with programming. Thus, showing gamification can positively impact programming learning by improving students' intrinsic motivation, although that effect changes over time depending on one's previous familiarity with programming.","Luiz","","Rodrigues","lalrodrigues@usp.br","","University of S?o Paulo","S?o Carlos","","Brazil"

This paper explored three years of AP CS A data in the Chicago Public School district (CPS) from 2016-2019 (N = 561). We analyzed the impact of teacher and student-level variables to determine the extent AP CS A course taking and exam passing differences existed between over- and under-represented populations. Our analyses suggest four prominent findings: (1) CPS, in collaboration with their Research-Practice Partnership (Chicago Alliance for Equity in Computer Science; CAF?CS), is broadening participation for students taking the AP CS A course; (2) Over- and under-represented students took the AP CS A exam at statistically comparable rates, suggesting differential encouragement to take or not take the AP CS A exam was not prevalent among these demographics; (3) After adjusting for teacher and student-level prior experience, there were no significant differences among over- and under-represented racial categorizations in their likelihoods to pass the AP CS A exam, albeit Female students were 3.3 times less likely to pass the exam than Males overall; (4) Taking the Exploring Computer Science course before AP CS A predicted students being 3.5 times more likely to pass the AP CS A exam than students that did not take ECS before AP CS A. Implications are discussed around secondary computer science course sequencing and lines of inquiry to encourage even greater broadening of participation in the AP CS A course and passing of the AP CS A exam.","Phillip","A.","Boda","paboda@lponline.net","","The Learning Partnership","Chicago","IL","USA"

"PT","cer497","Towards a Human-AI Hybrid System for Categorising Programming Problems","","7","As programming skills are increasingly required world-wide and across disciplines, many students use online platforms that provide automatic feedback through a Programming Online Judge (POJ) mechanism. POJs are very popular e-learning tools, boasting large collections of programming problems. Despite their many benefits, students often struggle when solving problems not compatible with their prior knowledge. One important cause of this is that usually statements of problems are not classified according to programming topics  (paradigms, data structures, etc.) and, hence, students waste time and effort in trying to solve exercises that are not tailored to their level and needs. Thus, to support students, we propose a new, ""front-heavy"" pipeline method to predict topics of POJ problems, using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for contextual text augmentation over the problem statements and further allowing for (lighter-weight) classical machine learning for classification. Our model outperformed all current state-of-the art, with an F1-score of 86% using stratified 10 fold cross-validation in a classically challenging multi-classification problem with seven categories. As a proof of concept, we conducted an experiment to show how our predictive model can be used as a human-AI hybrid complement for POJ, where learners would use AI-based recommendations to find the most appropriate problems.","Filipe Dwan","","Pereira","filipedwan@gmail.com","","Federal University of Roraima","Boa Vista","","Brazil"

Code com-prehension, i.e., understanding source code, is a critical skill for both learners and professionals. Improving learners? code comprehension skills should result in improved learning which in turn should help with retention in intro-to-programming courses which are notorious for suffering from very high attrition rates due to the complexity of programming topics. To this end, the reported experiment is meant to explore the effectiveness of various strategies to elicit self-explanation as a way to improve comprehension and learning during complex code comprehension and learning activities in intro-to-programming courses. The experiment showed pre-/post-test learning gains of 30% (M = 0.30, SD = 0.47) for the Free Self-Explanation condition and learning gains of 59% (M = 0.59,SD = 0.39) for the Socratic method. Furthermore, we investigated the behavior of the two strategies as a function of students? prior knowledge which was measured using learners? pretest score. For the Free Self-Explanation condition, there was no significant difference in mean learning gains for low vs. high knowledge students. The magnitude of the difference in performance (mean difference= 0.02,95% CI: -0.34 to 0.39) was very small (eta squared = 0.006).Likewise, the Socratic method showed no significant difference in mean learning gains between low vs. high performing students. The magnitude of the performance difference (mean difference =-0.24,95% CI: -0.534 to 0.03) was large (eta squared = 0.10). These findings suggest that eliciting self-explanations can be used as an effective strategy and that guided self-explanations as in the Socratic method condition is more effective at inducing learning gains.","Lasang","Jimba","Tamang","ljtamang@memphis.edu","","University of Memphis","Memphis","TN","USA"

In an effort to attract and engage students many summer camps and after-school clubs use robotics, video-games, and even IoT devices, but these approaches seem to only attract those already considering STEM careers, a population low in Black and Latino students. To attract Black and Latino students to computer science a promising approach is to engage with their culture, making CS relevant to them personally. To this end, we present an approach that teaches middle school students to program using hip hop beats, intentionally leveraging a genre of music that appeals to a wide array of urban youth of color. This approach, called Code Beats, uses extensive scaffolding to support beginning students, authentic-sounding beats to engage students, and a expressive programming environment to support creative freedom.
We present the results of our pilot camp, where students clearly showed an increase in computing enjoyment, confidence, belonging, and persistence. By the end of this course, all students were able to create their own, original beat from scratch, suggesting their progression to the Create phase of the Use-Modify-Create framework.","Douglas","","Lusa Krug","krugdl@vcu.edu","Department of Computer Science","Virginia Commonwealth University & Instituto Federal do Paran? - IFPR","Richmond","VA","USA"

This is particularly true for minoritized students in introductory CS courses. The methods used so far to study sense of belonging in CS have been qualitative or have used a small number of survey items. In this paper, we validate a large 30-item survey originally developed for Mathematics. We collected data from 21 institutions, with 30 faculty and 1165 survey responses. We present a factor analysis for the survey to highlight how it measures factors like 'Membership', 'Acceptance', 'Affect', 'Trust' and 'Desire to Fade'. We measured the students' sense of belonging using the survey and found that it correlates with their learning and their interest to pursue more CS courses. These correlations were nuanced based on students' gender, race, and the type of learning environment. We found that for minoritized students in particular, the interest to pursue CS courses was more correlated with their sense of belonging.
A type of learning environment we examined was Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). We studied the differences in sense of belonging between POGIL and non-POGIL classrooms. Although we did not find a significant difference in overall sense of belonging at the factor level, we did find significant differences when we examined at the item level. These results shed light about nuances in students' sense of belonging in CS POGIL classrooms when compared to other approaches.","Sukanya","Kannan","Moudgalya","moudgal1@msu.edu","","Michigan State University","East Lansing","MI","USA"

One common method for motivating students and reducing procrastination is to send reminders with hints and study strategies, but it's not clear if these messages are effective or when is the best time to send them. Randomized A/B comparisons could be used to try different reminders or alternative ideas about how best to get students to start work earlier and, crucially, to measure the impact of these interventions on behaviour. This paper describes an A/B comparison of reminder emails set in a large CS1 course at a research-focused North American university. We found evidence that the email interventions caused a higher proportion of students to attempt the online homework but did not see evidence that these particular emails got students to start early, irrespective of changes to the timing of the reminder. More broadly, these findings illustrate how to use A/B comparisons in educational settings to test ideas about how to help students, and demonstrate the value of using randomized A/B comparisons, even when evaluating actions that seem obviously beneficial, such as reminder emails.","Angela","","Zavaleta Bernuy","angelazb@cs.toronto.edu","Computer Science","University of Toronto","Toronto","ON","Canada"

However students sometimes rely on the autograder in place of careful thought for ways to improve to their solution. We sought to naturally encourage students to check their own solutions more, and hammer the grader less.  To do this, we imposed a penalty each time a student's grade went down: we called these regression penalties. We assessed whether the introduction of these penalties resulted in less reliance on the autograder without hurting student performance.

Encouragingly, the number of autograder submissions was reduced by roughly half while only slightly decreasing the median final grade. Students reported feeling nervous about their submissions, but noted that they checked their own solutions by testing their code far more than they would have without the penalty. Students also expressed positivity about the regression model.","Elisa","","Baniassad","ebani@cs.ubc.ca","Department of Computer Science","University of British Columbia","Vancouver","BC","Canada"

Drawing inspiration from Margolis and Fisher?s (2002) work drawing the ?blueprints? of the ?boy?s clubhouse? of computing education, as well as McDermott and Webber?s (2013) analysis of when math learning occurs, we ask when, where, and how is gender being invoked and created, as a way to unpack the places, events, and interactions that shape women?s participation in the Silicon Valley workforce. This qualitative analysis of 13 life history interviews with professional women in computing shows that gender becomes salient for women in public settings, particularly in early adulthood when women enter male-dominated classrooms, teams, and workplaces that foster ?brogramming? culture.

We analyzed survey responses and tool logs collected during a study at a large public university in a CS1 course (N=425). We found that students from all prior programming experience backgrounds made use of the ability to visualize code structures by using blocks. Students with prior experience in blocks or no prior experience said they felt the dual-modality instruction helped them understand code structure and meaning. As students progressed through the class, we found that they made more use of the blocks mode?s reference palettes than to its drag-and-drop facilities or mode-switching features.

An Empirical Analysis of GitHub Repositories","","7","Hackathons, the increasingly popular collaborative technology challenge events, are praised for producing modern solutions to real world problems. They have, however, recently been criticized for positing that serious real world problems can be solved in 24-48 hours of undergraduate coding. Projects created at hackathons are typically demos or proof-of-concepts, and little is known about the fate of them after the hackathon ends. Do they receive continued development in preparation for real world use and maintenance as part of actually being used, or are they abandoned? Since participants often use GitHub (Microsoft's popular version control system), it is possible to check. This quantitative, empirical study uses a series of Python scripts to complete a robust analysis of development patterns for all 11,889 of the U.S. based 2018-2019 Major League Hacking (MLH) affiliated hackathon projects which had GitHub repositories. Of these projects, approximately 85\% of commits were made within the first month, and approximately 77\% of the total commits occurred within the first week. Only 7\% of projects had any activity 6 months after the event ended. Evaluated projects had an average of only 3.097 distinct commit dates, and the average of commits divided by the length of the development period was only 0.1. This indicates that few projects receive the post-event attention expected of an actively developed project. Finally, this study offers a dialogue of possible ways to reformat hackathons to help increase the average longevity of the development period for projects.","Lukas","","McIntosh","mcintol@wwu.edu","Computer Science","Western Washington University","Bellingham","WA","USA"

Yet some code segments are common for reasons other than plagiarism or collusion, and so should not be considered. A few code similarity detection tools automatically remove very common segment, but they are prone to false results as no human validation is involved. This paper proposes a semi-automated approach for excluding common segments, where human validation is introduced before excluding the segments.
As existing selection techniques are not detachable from their similarity detection tools, we propose a new tool to independently select the segments (C2S2), along with several adjustable selection constraints to keep the number of suggested segments reasonable for manual observation. In order to independently evaluate automated selection techniques, we propose and apply three metrics. The evaluation shows our selection technique to be more effective and efficient than the basis underlying existing selection techniques, and establishes the benefit of each of its selection features.","Oscar","","Karnalim","oscar.karnalim@uon.edu.au","Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment & Faculty of Information Technology","University of Newcastle & Maranatha Christian University","Ourimbah","","Australia"

In this study, we seek to understand the experiences of non-native English speakers learning CS at a English-speaking university in the United States. Through weekly surveys and course grades from four CS courses, we investigate the differences between non-native and native English speakers with respect to the time spent studying outside of class, confidence levels at the start of a course, types of learning resources used, and expected and actual overall grades.

"PT","cer622","Online Vs Face-to-face Web-development Course: Course Strategies, Learning, and Engagement","","7","To address the increasing enrollment in Computer Science (CS), face-to-face (F2F) courses are often redesigned to online courses. For the success of a large-enrollment online CS class, it is important to design it with effective strategies that can enhance student learning and engagement. With this aim, we developed an online, third year web-development course, and redesigned its existing F2F version. This study focuses on examining the course strategies utilized in the two versions of of the course, and how students' learning and engagement vary between these two offerings. In Fall 2019, we conducted experimental research with pre- and post-tests to collect data from these two sections. The participants of the study include 51 out of 103 online students, and 38 out of 72 F2F students. We identified course strategies that were more valuable to one group versus the other, and both the sections. In terms of student learning, we found that there was no significant difference between these sections. Behavioral engagement measures depicted how the online and F2F students engaged within their courses, and how it is related to students' learning. We also found how the level of engagement varied in the online course according to the engagement factors that include performance, emotions, skills, and participation. The results of this study will inform online, F2F, and hybrid course design of upper-level CS courses.

"PT","cer623","Early Performance Prediction using Interpretable Patterns in Programming Process Data","","7","Instructors have limited time and resources to help struggling students, and these resources should be directed to the students who most need them. To address this, researchers have constructed models that can predict students' final course performance early in a semester. However, many predictive models are limited to static and generic student features (e.g. demographics, GPA), rather than computing-specific evidence that assesses a student's progress in class. Many programming environments now capture complete time-stamped records of students' actions during programming. In this work, we leverage this rich, fine-grained log data to build a model to predict student course outcomes. From the log data, we extract patterns of behaviors that are predictive of students' success using an approach called differential sequence mining. We evaluate our approach on a dataset from 106 students in a block-based, introductory programming course. The patterns extracted from our approach can predict final programming performance with 79\% accuracy using only the first programming assignment, outperforming two baseline methods. In addition, we show that the patterns are interpretable and correspond to concrete, effective -- and ineffective -- novice programming behaviors. We also discuss these patterns and their implications for classroom instruction.","Ge","","Gao","ggao5@ncsu.edu","","North Carolina State University","Raleigh","NC","USA"

Many instructors use online systems to deliver new course content and exercises, but students often delay assignments or game these systems (e.g., guessing on multiple-choice questions), often to the detriment of their learning. In an inverted CS1 course, many students self-reported high rates of gaming-the-system behavior, so we examine survey data to identify factors that contribute to engagement in these maladaptive behaviours. We supplement that analysis with interview data to gain a deeper understanding of the situation. We also implemented and evaluated a previously reported online intervention aimed at reducing gaming behavior. Unlike prior work, our intervention did not have a significant effect on guessing behavior. We discuss why the factors we identified might explain this result, as well as suggest future work to improve our understanding of gaming behaviours and inform the design of systems that encourage effective learning.","Jaemarie","","Solyst","jsolyst@andrew.cmu.edu","Human-Computer Interaction Institute","Carnegie Mellon University","Pittsburgh","PA","USA"

We expect this paper to be used by institutions as a guideline while planning their Data Science undergraduate degree. We reviewed around 100 undergraduate Data Science programs in the U.S. and summarized their common approaches and we also reviewed several Data Science curriculum development guidelines. Then, we developed our interdisciplinary undergraduate Data Science program that consists of (1) mathematics and statistics foundation courses covering discrete mathematics, linear algebra, introductory statistics, analysis of variance, and regression, (2) computer science foundation courses covering two programming languages (namely Python and Java), data structures, and database management, (3) core data science courses covering data science and visualization, statistical machine learning, data mining, and machine learning, and finally (4) courses from the business domain covering business intelligence analytics and predictive analytics. At the end of the degree program, we include a choice among a senior capstone course, a statistical consulting course, or an internship. We also discuss the collaboration between departments and colleges for this program.

"PT","ci056","Smacking Screws with Hammers: Experiencing Affordances of Block-based Programming through the Hourglass Challenge","","7","Block-based programming languages effectively address syntactic difficulties allowing users to more easily create code. Syntactic code support is no doubt a crucial step in enabling the next generation of programmers. However, in what other ways do these tools support the computational thinking (CT) process? For example, how is CT supported in both the semantic and pragmatic levels? Most users do not just want to write code?they want to create interesting artifacts such as video games, simulations, stories and robots. No doubt that users must code to build these artifacts, but just as important, though often overlooked, is that users must also have an understanding of tool affordances to effectively build these artifacts. The position presented in this paper is that the comprehension of affordances is essential to each stage of the computational thinking process. To that end, we introduce the Hourglass Challenge as a way for students to experience affordances through a programming challenge based on mis-aligned tools and problems. The results from a study, with 54 preservice elementary school teachers, indicate that the affordances of tools can have profound consequences on computational thinking. For instance, the affordances various tools provide can be the difference between creating a simulation versus an animation. But just as hammers are not intrinsically better tools than screwdrivers, the contribution of this position paper is not to compare tools, but to promote efforts that enable learners to develop a better understanding of computational thinking tool affordances as essential mediators between problems and tools.

The effort is led by members of a joint data science criteria subcommittee appointed by ABET?s Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) and CSAB (the lead society for computing accreditation).  Establishing data science accreditation criteria is a notable milestone in the maturing data science discipline, indicating the presence of an accepted body of knowledge, standards of practice, and ethical codes for practitioners.

This position paper motivates the effort and discusses prior work towards defining data science education requirements. It describes the ongoing process for creating and obtaining approval of the accreditation criteria, and how feedback was and will be solicited from the computing and statistical communities. The current draft data science criteria, which was approved in July 2020 by the relevant ABET bodies for a year of public review and comment, is presented. These criteria emphasize the three pillars of data science: computing foundations, mathematical/statistical foundations, and experience in at least one data application domain. This report thus serves both to inform and to stimulate the academic discussion needed to finalize appropriate data science accreditation by ABET.","Jean","R.

In the past two years the School of Education of FHNW, one of Switzerland?s largest schools of education, introduced a mandatory Computer Science education module, comprised of a two-course sequence for its students: pre-service primary-level schoolteachers. Due to its design and audience, this mandatory module introduces a variety of unique challenges. The module is taken by a majority of female students (75%), many with no prior experience and/or interest in programming and Computer Science. The module starts with a course focused on learning Computational Thinking, referred to as FW, followed by a course focused on teaching Computational Thinking, referred to as FD. Since 2017, 1000 pre-service primary-level teachers have been trained in Computer Science education through this module. This curricula initiative computes the effect sizes from teaching two complete iterations of the ?FW then FD? design. It is based on attitude assessment data collected at four points: Pre-FW, Post-FW, Pre-FD, Post-FD, during the first two years of this mandatory module. Our research indicates that, by course?s end, pre-service teachers are mostly confident in their ability to program and think computationally.

During this period, those driving Massachusetts?s efforts to develop a coherent and systemic approach to CS education have recognized the critical importance of grounding their work in a commitment to equity. 
Efforts within Massachusetts have largely focused on increasing the availability of CS courses in high schools across the state and, simultaneously, on developing a cadre of CS teachers to offer these courses. This paper offers an assessment of the state?s early-stage progress toward achieving its goals with respect to equity. We report on statistics comparing 2006 and 2016 for Massachusetts students on the Educational Testing Service?s AP Computer Science A exam (AP CS A), and data from the first two years of administration of CSP (2017-2018).
The analysis yields some ?good news? with respect to trends toward closing the gap for participation in AP CS test-taking by females and by Black and Latinx students, but some ?not so good news? with respect to performance data. Using Massachusetts as a case study, the paper considers implications of these data for revisiting strategies for addressing inequities in CS education.

Committed to the idea that tech ethics is an essential part of the undergraduate computer science educational curriculum, at Rice University this year we piloted a redesigned version of our Ethics and Accountability in Computer Science class. This effort represents our first attempt at implementing a ?deep? tech ethics approach to the course. Incorporating elements from philosophy of technology, critical media theory, and science and technology studies, we encouraged students to learn not only ethics in a ?shallow? sense, examining abstract principles or values to determine right and wrong, but rather looking at a series of ?deeper? questions more closely related to present issues of social justice and relying on a structural understanding of these problems to develop potential sociotechnical solutions. In this article, we report on our implementation of this redesigned approach. We describe in detail the rationale and strategy for implementing this approach, present key elements of the redesigned syllabus, and discuss final student reflections and course evaluations. To conclude, we examine course achievements, limitations, and lessons learned toward the future, particularly in regard to the number escalating social protests and issues involving Covid-19.","Rodrigo","","Ferreira","rf29@rice.edu","Computer Science","Rice University","Houston","TX","USA"

The expanse of user-generated information available online can be a powerful influence both on the individual and large collectives of people. In recent years disinformation and misinformation on social media have been used to spread hate and divisiveness and, in extreme cases, incite violence. Now, more than ever, it is important to empower minority youth to be good cybercitizens by converting them from passive consumers of unreliable information to knowledgeable contributors of credible data. 
In this paper, we demonstrate the value of using social injustice as a means of engaging minority youth in computing and data sciences. We have identified effective methods of teaching high school students applied data analysis techniques that provide insight into issues directly affecting them, their families, and their communities. We believe this approach can be used to not only strengthen the pipeline to continued education and careers in computing fields, but also provide an alternative medium for action in a contentious world.

While empirical efforts have advanced pedagogy, created innovative learning tools, and deepened our understanding of learner cognition, we are still failing many students. Disparities in who can access and who succeeds in CS persist. In this position paper I argue that we need to reconsider how we approach CS education research (CSER). Prior research discussions have focused on methodologies, but research designs are influenced by more than strategies and methods of data collection. They are also guided by philosophies of how the world works. Philosophical views dominant in CSER have served us well in answering questions such as which instructional approaches lead to greater achievement or how do alternative programming conceptions develop. However, confronting systemic problems that prevent some learners from being at the table might require a transformative research lens. I introduce critical theory as a means to put inequities and the voices of the marginalized at the fore of our research. This is demonstrated through the analysis of three examples: a narrative ethnographic analysis of the power differences in a researcher practitioner partnership serving Latinx youth; an autoethnography of a Black scholar?s journey into an IT career; and a survey study examining the relationship between interest, stereotypes and CS career intentions in students from minoritized groups. Lastly, I offer a call to action for increasing the use and acceptance of critical theory in our dissemination venues and professional development opportunities.","Aleata","","Hubbard Cheuoua","ahubbar@wested.org","","WestEd","Redwood City","CA","USA"

This is a topic that has relevance in any team work setting, in particular in Software Engineering (SE) where team work is central.

We augment the teaching of team work skills to tertiary SE students through the application of the Jungian personality types. We describe how we introduce the Jungian personality dimensions. We propose an innovative method to gather information about the personality preferences of our students. The method deviates from the usual as it does not use a personality inventory survey. Instead it relies on self-rating and observations made by peers.

We give an account of the activities we implement to instil understanding of the personality concepts associated with the Jungian personality types. We discuss how the students' participation in these activities  helped them to apply these concepts to improve their interpersonal skills and teamwork skills. We discuss the implications of our observations. Our method to teaches students about differences between people using the Jungian personality types as a basis to highlight these differences and how they can capitalise on these differences. At the same time, knowledge of these differences help students who may feel different, because they gain awareness of the value of these differences. We conclude that the practicality of knowledge of the Jungian personality types is beneficial in our context.","Vreda","","Pieterse","vreda.pieterse@tuks.co.za","","Open University of the Netherlands","Heerlen","","Netherlands"

However, there is a serious deficit of qualified talent in this field?and thus a corresponding shortage of educational programs.  To address the shortage of ML specialists in the field, universities are offering continuing education programs that fast-track the development of technical and transverse skills needed for success in the field.  The award-winning machine learning program described in this paper is carefully designed with industry and community partners while focusing on practical skills and participation in the local industry network. This program can be summarized in three learning principles:  1) learners are encouraged to build their knowledge and skills in a self-directed manner; 2) group projects in both simulated and workplace settings are incorporated to support problem-based learning; and 3) supportive learning environment is established to encourage open and safe learning.  This paper reports on the instructors' experiences in teaching the four courses based on these principles, which has resulted in high satisfaction from students, successfully placing students in industry, and winning a national award. We offer this experiential report in the hope that it may serve as a point of reference for other instructors and programs for mature technical learners in machine learning.","En-Shiun","Annie","Lee","ealee@yorku.ca","","York University","Toronto","ON","Canada"

The issue of continuous under-representation for Black/African Americans is especially telling of a pressing digital divide issue. Members of this group comprise roughly 13% of the U.S. population, but disproportionately hold only 5% and 8% of computer engineering and computer science bachelor?s degrees. Studies suggest that computing culture and stereotypes associated with the discipline and its practitioners are among the varied contributors to sociocultural rifts between Black students and computing. This disconnect impacts students? computational and technological identities, which may result in these students deciding to ?disidentify? with computing, and to pursue academic disciplines in which they experience higher self-efficacy. Despite comprising only 4% of U.S. universities, Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs) produce 31% of the Black STEM bachelor's degrees. Still, HBCU computing departments face unique retention issues that impact student matriculation through computer science (CS) degrees. As there are few course-based efforts geared toward cultivating students? computing identities, this position paper highlights the need for formal attention to the fostering of these identities. It presents HBCU computing departments as key centers for beginning to address traditional computing culture and identity-related attrition issues for Black students.

"PT","ci480","Toward A Framework for Formative Assessment of Conceptual Learning in K-12 Computer Science Classrooms","","7","Unlike summative assessment that is aimed at grading students at the end of a unit or academic term, formative assessment is assess- ment for learning, aimed at monitoring ongoing student learning to provide feedback to both student and teacher, so that learning gaps can be addressed during the learning process. Education research points to formative assessment as a crucial vehicle for improving student learning. Formative assessment in K-12 CS and program- ming classrooms remains a crucial unaddressed need. Given that assessment for learning is closely tied to teacher pedagogical con- tent knowledge, formative assessment literacy needs to also be a topic of CS teacher PD. This position paper addresses the broad need to understand formative assessment and build a framework to understand the what, why, and how of formative assessment of introductory programming in K-12 CS. It shares specific pro- gramming examples to articulate the cycle of formative assessment, diagnostic evaluation, feedback, and action. The design of formative assessment items is informed by CS research on assessment design, albeit related largely to summative assessment and in CS1 contexts, and learning of programming, especially student misconceptions. It describes what teacher formative assessment literacy PD should entail and how to catalyze assessment-focused collaboration among K-12 CS teachers through assessment platforms and repositories.","Shuchi","","Grover","shuchig@cs.stanford.edu","","Looking Glass Ventures &#38; Stanford University","Palo Alto","CA","USA"
"PT","ci523","Toward an Ungraded CS50","","6","In 2010, we proposed to eliminate letter grades in CS50 at Harvard University in favor of Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (SAT/UNS), whereby students would instead receive at term's end a grade of SAT in lieu of A through C- or UNS in lieu of D+ through E. Albeit designed to empower students without prior background to explore an area beyond their comfort zone without fear of failure, that proposal initially failed. Not only were some concentrations on campus unwilling to grant credit for SAT, the university's program in general education (of which CS50 was part) required that all courses be taken for letter grades.

In 2013, we instead proposed, this time successfully, to allow students to take CS50 either for a letter grade or SAT/UNS. And in 2017, we made SAT/UNS the course's default, though students could still opt out. The percentage of students taking the course SAT/UNS jumped that year to 31%, up from 9% in the year prior, with as many as 86 of the course's 671 students (13%) reporting that they enrolled because of SAT/UNS. The percentage of women in the course also increased to 44%, a 29-year high. And 19% of students who took the course SAT/UNS subsequently reported that their concentration would be or might be CS. Despite concerns to the contrary, students taking the course SAT/UNS reported spending not less but more time on the course each week than letter-graded classmates. And, once we accounted for prior background, they performed nearly the same.

We present the challenges and results of this 10-year initiative. We argue ultimately in favor of SAT/UNS, provided students must still meet all expectations, including all work submitted, in order to be eligible for SAT.","David","J.","Malan","malan@harvard.edu","","Harvard University","Cambridge","MA","USA"
"PT","ci537","Creating a Multifarious Cyber Science Major","","7","Existing approaches to computing-based cyber undergraduate majors typically take one of two forms: a broad exploration of both technical and human aspects, or a deep technical exploration of a single discipline relevant to cybersecurity. This paper describes the creation of a third approach--a multifarious major, consistent with Cybersecurity Curricula 2017, the ABET Cybersecurity Program Criteria, and the National Security Agency Center for Academic Excellence--Cyber Operations criteria. Our novel curriculum relies on a 10-course common foundation extended by one of five possible concentrations, each of which is delivered through a disciplinary lens and specialized into a highly relevant computing interest area serving society?s diverse cyber needs. The journey began years ago when we infused cybersecurity education throughout our programs, seeking to keep offerings and extracurricular activities relevant in society?s increasingly complex relationship with cyberspace. This paper details the overarching design principles, decision-making process, benchmarking, and feedback elicitation activities. A surprising key step was merging several curricula proposals into a single hybrid option.  The new major attracted a strong initial cohort, meeting our enrollment goals and exceeding our diversity goals. We provide several recommendations for any institution embarking on a process of designing a new cyber-named major.","Raymond","W.","Blaine","raymond.blaine@westpoint.edu","","U.S Military Academy","West Point","NY","USA"

This topic is difficult to teach due to the significant amount of terminology and interacting design parameters and policies. Simulators have been used as a valuable pedagogical tool for visualizing the changes in cache state due to memory accesses; for educational purposes, there are three varieties: command-line, GUI, and online.  Command-line simulators tend to have limited visual output and require recompilation. GUI simulators are more visual but require downloading and installation. Online simulators are easily accessible but have the fewest features. We introduce the UW CSE351 Cache Simulator, an interactive, web-based tool that lets users observe the processes and study the fundamental concepts and policies of caching. It is implemented in p5.js, a JavaScript library, and is based on CAMERA, but improves upon the functionality and usability in a number of ways, including web access, a single interface instead of multiple workbenches, the ability to change cache policies (e.g., write and replacement), and a navigable access history. Attendees will be provided a handout with a feature list, references to other cache simulators/visualizers for educational purposes, and example student activities and exercises that use the UW CSE351 Cache Simulator.","Justin","","Hsia","jhsia@cs.washington.edu","","University of Washington","Seattle","WA","USA"

However, it is less frequent for them to have an innate mental model of higher-level tree and hash-based data structures. This demo will highlight the CS2Mulch project, which provides engaging manipulatives for demonstrating concepts in advanced data structures to build these mental models. Instructors can use these tools to support lessons on sorting algorithms, binary search trees, heaps, sets, and hash tables. Two original decks of cards form the basis for interactive classroom games and collaborative peer exercises in CS2. The Acorns deck consists of cards numbered with integers 00-69. These cards can be overlapped on the corners to demonstrate insertion and removal algorithms for binary trees or heaps. The Menagerie deck consists of cards that display an animal, along with two integers computed by passing the name through two simple hash functions, Murmur3 and FNV, modulo 8. Additional cards are numbered 0 to 7, to be used as markers for arrays within hash table implementations. The CS2Mulch decks, along with lesson plans and supporting materials, are freely available at https://mgoadric.github.io/cs2mulch/, either for PDF download, virtually through the online board game software Tabletopia, or for purchase through on-demand printing at The Game Crafter.

However, little work has been done on using blocks languages to teach adults, and even less work has looked at blocks languages for data science. We have integrated Blockly, a blocks-based programming environment, into JupyterLab, one of the leading computational notebook development environments for data science. Our integration, which is publicly released as a JupyterLab extension, allows users to assemble blocks-based programs in a GUI workspace and then render the blocks as textual code (e.g., Python) in a computational notebook cell. Additional features of the extension are notebook sync, which clears and restores the blocks workspace as the user navigates to different notebook cells, and intelliblocks, dynamically generated blocks that are created when users load software packages. In this demonstration, we show how learners can use blocks to solve data science problems in a JupyterLab computational notebook. We have released 20 worked example companion notebooks at https://github.com/memphis-iis/datawhys-content-notebooks and an extended tutorial on the extension at https://youtu.be/-luPzplPDI0.

Python code. As a pure Python package, Pedal is compatible with a wide range of autograding platforms, including GradeScope, VPL, WebCAT, and BlockPy - as long as the platform allows package installation, Pedal should work. Pedal is a collection of modular program analysis tools exposed with a declarative interface, built around a centralized infrastructure. These tools include a sandboxed execution environment for running students? code with enhanced tracebacks, pattern matching syntax for specifying common student mistakes, basic type inference and flow analysis, random question pools, and a library of over 60 high-level, pedagogically-oriented assertions. Pedal?s model for these tools synthesizes the detection of conditions and their instructor-mediated responses, encapsulated into dedicated feedback functions that can be tracked and modified as first-class objects. Our goal is to elevate Feedback with Software Engineering and Instructional Design practices, to become a central part of your course?s development rather than an afterthought. Our toolchain also includes command lines utilities for unit testing your feedback to verify behavior and analyze collected programming snapshot data. Our hope is that adoptees will find that Pedal expands the power of their autograder and opens new avenues of research.","Austin","Cory","Bart","acbart@udel.edu","","University of Delaware","Newark","DE","USA"

Their subsequent in-class study revealed that students enjoy learning with coding strips and benefit from them in various ways. Unfortunately, creating comics can be a time-consuming and challenging task; this can compromise the usefulness and adoption of coding strips. Thus in this demo, we introduce CodingToon, an authoring tool for coding strips, and provide a brief tutorial to help interested instructors use coding strips in their classrooms.

Now more than ever, it is crucial to provide students with factual information about how diseases spread and how their own actions can impact that spread. In order to both encourage computational thinking skills and build scientific knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have created a series of programming activities through which students construct their own computational models based on the emerging scientific consensus around COVID-19. Students are able to model everyday situations such as being in a crowded area or going to stores while unknowingly infected, and immediately see the consequences of those actions. By including accurate scientific variables such as the reproductive number of the virus, incubation period, and period of communicability, students are able to create their own epi-curves that demonstrate the severity of the disease and provide students with visual representation of how quickly COVID-19 spreads. We also use the scientific model and associated modeling activities to reinforce best practices at home and in the community.

"PT","d906","FDP: A Teaching and Demonstration Platform for Networking","","1","Requesting https://www.wikipedia.org from your browser can start a small storm of exchanges between your device and name servers, caches and ultimately the Wikipedia servers. Data networking involves simple ideas---such as modular decomposition and path redundancy---that produce interesting behavior through the, sometimes subtle, interaction with one another. Through this interaction, networking is able to achieve amazing feats of reliability, availability, and planetary scale. But it is difficult to connect the big ideas---such as reliability---with how they work across different implementations, topologies and in the face of different levels of network disfunction. Making that leap typically requires time spent with unforgiving tools such as ?tcpdump? across several experiments. This is not helped by the hearty alphabet soup that is the set of protocols that one has to learn to begin to understand how networking really works. 
To help teachers and students navigate this process, we present FDP, a portable platform that enables end-to-end experimentation and zero-effort in browser interactive visualization, which we envision can benefit teaching and demonstration. FDP can show various network, including network faults and reconfigurations, using visual cues and quantitative graphing. Since we leverage the flexibility of software-defined networking (SDN), our tool can also be used for upper-level networks classes and also for research.","Heena","","Nagda","heenan@gatech.edu","Computer Science","Georgia Institute of Technology","Atlanta","GA","USA"

However, the most powerful ?big idea? is the introduction of an APL-style programming paradigm, which we call ?Hyperblocks?. This augments all existing reporter-block scalar inputs to accept N-dimensional lists of any shape as arguments as well, instead of being considered a domain error. These ?dimension-generic? blocks allow us to teach complex concepts without the need for loops or our beloved map block. For example, the domain of the multiply block had previously only been numbers, and if we had wanted to return a new list in which all of the elements were multiplied by 10, we would have had to use map(10*( ))over(data). Now we can simply say 10*data! In Snap! 6, Hyperblocks enable fast vectorized computations, making it much more efficient to do data analysis and media computation projects. There?s nothing that beats a live demonstration of all these wonderful features, and we have two veteran power users to take it through its paces.

The module demonstrates one of the important Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, known as Reflow, using hands-on experience. Reflow is a particularly essential feature for the accessibility of webpages for people with cognitive impairments. The module consists of an interactive lecture and engaging quizzes. We held an online one-hour workshop where the activity was presented to 52 high school students. We collected objective and subjective data about students' knowledge and learning experience using 3 questionnaires. Our findings indicate that the module is effective in raising students' awareness of disabilities, leveraging their knowledge on accessibility, and maintaining high interest in pursuing a computing degree.","Brian","","Kelly","bk7031@rit.edu","","Rochester Institute of Technology","Rochester","NY","USA"

Our work builds on previous studies involving Parsons Problems by showing that it was possible to have students encode the solution to a Parsons Problem on a special purpose bubble sheet.  This allowed students to answer Parsons Problems in a traditional paper-based exam environment while also allowing their responses to be scanned and scored automatically.  The nature of the special purpose bubble sheet is described, as is the proof-of-concept software that was developed to analyze the bubble sheets, evaluate the student responses, and distribute the graded responses back to the students.  Written feedback received from students on end-of-course surveys showed that the vast majority of students considered electronically scorable Parsons Problems to be a fair and reasonable evaluation technique in a large introductory course, and only minimal concerns were raised about the need to record their solutions on a bubble sheet.

"PT","ert028","Computing Ethics Narratives&#58; Teaching Computing Ethics and the Impact of Predictive Algorithms","","7","The prevention of criminal activity has changed dramatically over the past two decades, largely due to the increased reliance on systems that provide crime data analysis. Created specifically for police, judicial sentencing, and prison applications, these systems conduct both predictive and retrospective analysis to aid decision making within the criminal justice system. Furthermore, these software platforms typically combine spatial informatics packages and advanced statistical features behind user-friendly interfaces. Recent studies have demonstrated problems with both the flawed logic within these systems? algorithms and the inherent biases in the underlying data. In this paper, we present a novel repository of computing ethics teaching modules across a variety of narrative areas. These modules and curated narratives help faculty to establish ?ethical laboratories? that can guide computer science students in improving their ethical reasoning skills as it relates to the creation of current and future technologies. First, we provide an overview of the Computing Ethics Narratives (CEN) project, its narrative repository and the module framework through a sample module on predictive policing algorithms. Furthermore, we share preliminary findings from a pilot of this module, which was implemented in an intermediate algorithms course. The preliminary student and faculty feedback suggest the predictive policing module was able to help students contextualize the ethical issues around the topic, however, students recommended devoting more class time to evaluating the technical complexities of these critical systems.","Beleicia","B.","Bullock","bbb4@illiois.edu","Department of Computer Science","University of Illinois","Urbana-Champaign","IL","USA"

Within the biology-based cohort, we also contrast the futures of the students who chose a biology-themed introduction with the group who expressed no preference or requested the breadth-based approach. Even when student preference was not accommodated, equitable downstream performance results hold.

The course content includes OoO scheduling algorithms for instructions to exploit instruction-level parallelism (ILP), example microarchitectures, caching, prefetching, and virtual memory. The labs and projects help students gain proficiency with the SystemVerilog language. 

Students use the concepts learned in class to design processors with the goals of achieving correctness and high performance for a suite of test programs representative of different data structures and algorithms. Using RISC-V enables students to validate and benchmark their designs by compiling test programs using GCC with a custom linker. By collaborating as a team, students learn how to write and debug a large code base over the two-month project.

Like most educational systems worldwide, which were suddenly shut down during the outbreak of the corona pandemic, the Israeli education system was closed from March 12, 2020 until the end of the school year. However, since the national CS matriculation exam was scheduled for June 24, 2020, and since not all teachers finished teaching all of the required material and preparing their pupils for the exam, the Central CS Supervisory Unit, at the Ministry of Education, launched the CS-orona initiative whose purpose was to support teachers and pupils in their preparation for the matriculation exam. The initiative was implemented mainly (but not only) through Zoom presentations by volunteer teachers, who presented lessons to their colleagues and to pupils located throughout Israel. 
In this paper, we present the framework of the CS-orona initiative, teachers? perceptions of its effectiveness, and lessons learned. Data was collected through questionnaires sent to (a) teachers who attended the lessons; (b) teachers who presented lessons to other teachers and pupils; and (c) pupils located throughout the country. We analyzed the data mainly according to Maslow?s theory of needs, and show that the CS-orona initiative a) enabled teachers who attended lessons to fulfill their needs for safety and b) enabled teachers who presented lessens, to fulfill their need for belongingness and need for appreciation and self-esteem.","Rachel","","Perelman","rachelperlmann@gmail.com","","Ministry of Education","Tel Aviv","","Israel"

"PT","ert108","Learning from the Impossible: Introducing Theoretical Computer Science in CS Mathematics Courses","","7","The low academic results and mathematical difficulties experienced by students in learning theoretical computer science have been one of the reasons why many undergraduate students postpone the study of their theoretical subjects until absolutely necessary. For this reason, some optional theoretical subjects have been postponed for the last years, and in some cases, not included in the curricula due to lack of students. In order to reverse this problematic situation in theoretical computing education, it is essential that students acquire as soon as possible an intuitive and progressive knowledge of the main theoretical computing concepts and their associated skills and abilities. To achieve this goal, in this paper we offer a complete educational methodology to systematically introduce questions of computability and algorithmic complexity, in the early years of computer science and mathematics degrees, from the results of impossibility that are already included in the curriculum of CS-geared mathematics courses. To provide clear evidence of the impact of the applicability of the proposed methodology, we analyze the experimental results and student feedback we have obtained to confirm that the introduction of theoretical computing questions from impossibility results increases students' academic results in theoretical computing subjects, and motivation and interest in studying mathematical subjects of beginning level of computer science.","Rafael","","del Vado V?rseda","rdelvado@mat.ucm.es","Departamento de Sistemas Inform?ticos y Computaci?n","Universidad Complutense de Madrid","Madrid","","Spain"
"PT","ert143","Combining Theory and Practice in Data Structures & Algorithms Course Projects: An Experience Report","","7","CS2 course projects can often be too prescriptive by telling students which algorithms or data structures are necessary to efficiently solve a given problem. Students may not fully understand why these algorithms or data structures were chosen, and they may not have an opportunity to empirically observe the impact of such design decisions. In 2019, we redesigned our CS2 course projects at North Carolina State University to help demonstrate the importance of critical-thinking and analysis activities when developing software. The objective of the redesigned course project is to connect computer science theory with software development practice by incorporating algorithm design and analysis, data structure selection, and experimental analysis as part of the software development lifecycle. For the project, students first create a design proposal that incorporates algorithm design and analysis, data structure selection, and other software design tasks. Next, students implement and test their software, while teaching staff test cases impose grade penalties for incorrect and/or inefficient implementations. Finally, students perform experimental analysis to empirically observe performance differences when using different data structures. Between January 2019 and May 2020, we collected end-of-course survey responses from 202 out of 536 students (37.7\% response rate). Overall, 90.6\% of respondents indicated that the project helped with understanding the importance of analysis and design when developing software. In this paper, we discuss our project activities in detail, along with lessons learned and suggestions for adopting similar projects in other CS2 courses.","Jason","","King","jtking@ncsu.edu","Department of Computer Science","North Carolina State University","Raleigh","NC","USA"

Strong arguments have been made for integration--- constructing activities that not only teach CS, but use the CS to support learning in a core subject. Integrating CS materials into a specific curriculum is a non-trivial task that may unfairly burden elementary teachers, who are often generalists. Successful development and classroom implementation of integrated materials relies on many decisions about what, when, and how much subject matter to cover in relation to the main curriculum. 

In this paper, we describe the design of a collection of 3rd and 4th grade (8?10 years old) integrated math+CS lessons. Our instructional materials use Scratch as a programming language and employ a learning trajectory approach to integrate the CS concepts of sequence, decomposition, repetition, conditionals, variables, and debugging into fractions content in a popular elementary mathematics curriculum. The integrated lessons are inserted throughout the main mathematics curriculum, providing multiple, non-continuous exposures to CS content. In addition, we present preliminary data from selected activities, including teacher feedback about the structure and impact of the math+CS instructional materials on their students? work.","Carla","","Strickland","castrickland@uchicago.edu","UChicago STEM Education","University of Chicago","Chicago","IL","USA"

The educational model we use is based upon students progressing through weekly tasks designed to support development, and measure achievement of learning outcomes. In this model, once a student has completed a task, interactions between the student and instructor provide feedback to the instructor of the student's understanding. The feedback system gives confidence that the student understands their work and aids in identifying learning intervention opportunities. To achieve this asynchronously, we developed and integrated an audio-discussion tool known as Real Talk into our Learning Management System (LMS). The tool allows instructors to record discussion prompts tailored to a student's completed task and has the LMS replay the prompt(s) and immediately capturing the student's response. These interactions replicate essential aspects of face-to-face, in-person discussions by not affording the student opportunities to research and rehearse responses, which we previously experienced when using asynchronous discussion or quiz tools for this purpose. In this paper, we present the implementation of the Real Talk tool and discuss results evaluating how effective it was at allowing instructors to identify opportunities for learning interventions in introductory computing courses. The results confirmed that the tool has assisted in identifying knowledge gaps not identifiable in students' submissions alone.","Jake","","Renzella","jake.renzella@deakin.edu.au","School of Information Technology","Deakin University","Geelong","","Australia"

"PT","ert189","Integrating Ethics into Introductory Programming Classes","","7","Increasing attention to the role of ethical consideration in computing has led to calls for greater integration of this critical topic into technical classes rather than siloed in standalone computing ethics classes. The motivation for such integration is not only to support in-situ learning, but also to emphasize to students that ethical consideration is inherently part of the technical practice of computing. We propose that the logical place to begin emphasizing ethics is on day one of computing education: in introductory programming classes. This paper presents one approach to ethics integration into such classes: assignments that teach basic programming concepts (e.g., conditionals or iteration) but are contextualized with real-world ethical dilemmas or concepts. We report on experiences with this approach in multiple introductory programming courses, including details about select assignments, insights from instructors and teaching assistants, and results from surveys of a subset of students who took these courses. Based on these experiences we provide preliminary plans for future work, along with a roadmap for instructors to emulate our approach and suggestions for overcoming challenges they might face.

The choice of this type of summative assessment was prompted by the emergency remote instruction instituted in the middle of the Spring 2020 semester, across colleges and universities in the U.S., due to the coronavirus pandemic. The principles that guided our oral assessment  design were: to develop a more comprehensive measure of student competence and mitigate exam cheating; to facilitate communication and workplace skills through student-teacher interaction; and to alleviate negative emotions associated with traditional summative assessments. 

We report on the oral assessment features and logistics. To gain insights into the impact of this form of assessment,  we conducted a student survey to learn about their emotional reactions and perceptions of assessment effectiveness. Mean scores of positive emotions (enjoyment, hope, pride, relief) were higher than negative emotions (anger, anxiety, hopelessness) across all three courses.  Students found the personalized, interactive nature of the exam helpful in advancing their learning and communication skills. Many believed the oral exam to be a more accurate assessment of their knowledge than traditional methods. Additionally, feedback from the two instructors who implemented the oral assessments indicates that they enjoyed the experience and will use the lessons learned to improve the use of oral assessments in the future.

The report covers four courses in a large university?s computer science program, ranging from first-year to third-year. With the data generated by students taking both in-person and online exams in multiple courses, we perform analyses to evaluate the validity of the online exams (especially the unproctored ones) as an assessment of student understanding. With the fine-grained student activity data provided by the online exam platform, we are also able to investigate the patterns in student exam-taking behaviours and their correlations with student performance on the exam. In addition, we share, in detail, the tips and lessons that were learned throughout the process of designing, implementing, and hosting the online exams.","Larry Yueli","","Zhang","ylzhang@cs.toronto.edu","","University of Toronto Mississauga","Mississauga","ON","Canada"

However, these skills are often difficult to learn for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We designed, developed, and ran a 13-day, remote video game coding camp for incoming college first-year students with ASD. We developed instructional materials to teach computer programming, video game design, and communication and teaming skills. Students used the MakeCode Arcade development environment to build their games and Zoom to remotely collaborate with their teammates. In summative interviews, students reported improved programming skills,  increased confidence in communication, and better experiences working with others. We also found that students valued the opportunity to practice teaming, such as being more vocal in expressing ideas to their peers and working out differences of opinion with their teammates. Two students reported the remote learning environment decreased their anxiety and stress, both are frequent challenges for autistic people. We plan to rerun the camp next year with materials that we have made available online.","Andrew","","Begel","andrew.begel@microsoft.com","","Microsoft Research","Redmond","WI","USA"

Grounded in theory from the Learning Sciences, the tool -- a collaborative, online IDE -- has two primary goals: 1) to help introductory CS students achieve pair programming success; and 2) to research what factors contribute to pairs that have beneficial outcomes. We present our learnings from the use of \textit{PearProgram} in three remote introductory CS courses: a CS1 course, and two large international courses, including one for high school students. Teacher and student users responded positively to \textit{PearProgram}, and use of the tool was associated with beneficial learning outcomes in these online learning environments. Our research opens many future research directions for (remote) pair programming, and indicates practices that may prove useful for CS educators at all levels.","Maxwell","","Bigman","mbigman@stanford.edu","Graduate School of Education","Stanford University","Stanford","CA","USA"

"PT","ert243","Building Community in a Competitive Undergraduate Program","","7","As with many other institutions, there is currently far more student interest in our undergraduate Computer Science major than we can accommodate. Our institution limits the capacity of the Computer Science major and uses a competitive, grades-based admission process for students to gain admission at the end of their first year of study. This competitive admission process has had a notable negative impact on the student experience in first-year, as students are especially driven to earn top grades. The competition also encourages students to prioritize academics over everything else.</par><par>Although we are taking measures to improve the first-year experience, this competitive, grades-focused culture is still at risk of carrying forward into the subsequent years of our major.  This is an issue on top of more widespread challenges faced by many CS programs in retaining students through to graduation. To improve the student experience of those admitted to a Computer Science major, we developed the Second-year Learning Community (SLC) program. This co-curricular program aims to foster a sense of community, and connect students to their peers and to other members of our academic and local tech communities.</par><par>We report on our experience developing and offering the SLC program, including our program curriculum, and resources required. We also share feedback from participants, and outline lessons learned. Overall, the program was well-received by student participants, as well as by student and faculty mentors. It is a relatively low-cost initiative, and its success in Computer Science has led to expansion to nine other departments.","Jacqueline","","Smith","jsmith@cs.toronto.edu","","University of Toronto","Toronto","ON","Canada"

Based on a collaboration among two public research universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA, the goal of the project is to establish an institutionalized middle school computer science curriculum in the districts. The CS curriculum incorporates digital literacy skills as an integral aspect of learning computer science, and is based on students developing mobile apps that provide social and community good. Here, we share our professional learning process during the project?s first year, which had been developed iteratively and dynamically adjusted to a remote format in response to exigencies of Spring 2020. The paper includes analysis of three data sets from teacher-participants: (1) their questions about the nature of the project, which we categorized into three levels: project, district and teacher levels. These questions bridge the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners; (2) analysis of semi-structured interview conversations with more than half of the teacher-participants; and (3) teacher survey responses. Our findings include two recommendations: that RPP projects elicit teacher questions to illuminate the three levels identified, and use strategies that engage teachers in designing a professional learning process for teaching computer science.","Lijun","","Ni","lni@albany.edu","","University at Albany, State University of New York","Albany","NY","USA"

"PT","ert301","A Game-Based Approach for Teaching Algorithms and Data Structures using Visualizations","","7","Data structures and algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts introduced in the early stages of any undergraduate computing degree.  Many students find DSA concepts challenging to learn, partly due to their abstract nature but also due to issues of low motivation.  We examine these and other common difficulties faced by educators teaching DSA, and present a novel solution which combines a game-based learning approach with the use of engaging visualizations of algorithms in 2.5D.  Game-based learning and algorithm visualizations are often employed in existing educational tools, but are rarely combined.  Our game, DeCode, presents DSA concepts as in-game objects and animations within a 2.5D game-based world alongside traditional game-like mechanics such as progression. Feedback from an initial pilot study (n=51) suggests that students regard DeCode as an enjoyable and effective tool for learning DSA concepts.  We also find evidence that DeCode's visualizations help students find efficient solutions to problems that have received prior attention in the literature, such as shifting all of the elements in an array.","Simon","","Su","zsu801@aucklanduni.ac.nz","","University of Auckland","Auckland","","New Zealand"

"PT","ert318","Learning UML Sequence Diagrams with a New Constructivist Pedagogical Tool: SD4ED","","7","Increasingly, students from many different majors are taking foundational courses in Software Engineering (SE) where modelling forms a major part. Novices with limited Object-Oriented (OO) programming skills often find OO modelling concepts abstract and difficult when compared to other topics. In particular, dynamic modelling of sequence diagrams (SDs) was shown to pose the most difficulties when novices learn UML modelling. Novices often do not consider how SDs are constrained by static models such as class diagrams and fail to meet some of the postconditions specified in the use case descriptions. These problems are exacerbated for instructors teaching large classes unable to give adequate formative feedback in the early stages, leading to poor student satisfaction and learning outcomes. This paper explores the efficacy of using a constructivist-learning tool in large classes able to give immediate feedback in the early stages. 
In this paper, we report our experience of developing an interactive pedagogical tool called SD4ED to help students learn SDs. The main novelty of our approach is the mechanism devised to provide instant feedback while students are creating the SDs based on the constraints for the underlying static model, postconditions specified for the underlying use case and the current knowledge state aggregating past messages. Unlike other UML tools developed in the past, our tool helps students to create consistent and complete models using a constructivist approach. Our pre- and post-tests and survey feedback showed substantially improved learning outcomes and student satisfaction.

Most curricula focus on technical skills. Team project methodologies are often used as a way to improve students? communication skills. However, the student teams are usually only comprised of computer science students. This paper is an experience report of the didactical methodology used in a project called GGULIVRR@Lodz, which has run annually since 2014. The project is short, intensive and team-based, with an important requirement that each student team is multinational and multidisciplinary. In the project, university lecturers act as mentors who help the student teams organize their work and tracks if a team?s planned didactical results are being achieved. 
The GGULIVRR@Lodz project stimulates an increase of soft-skills among IT and other students who participate in the project. The detailed description of our process will allow others to recreate the project or build similar events in colleges or even company environments.

Google?s exploreCSR supports institutions across the US to execute IREs in computing throughout the academic year. We describe the program design and framework, the evaluation model, and present outcomes from two years of implementation across 29 institutions, with 1,983 (92% female) student participants collectively. The unique features of the program are that it aligns goals, measurements, and best practices across a national network of hands-on, localized IREs, resulting in peer communities and a sizable sample of undergraduates who identify as women and/or African-American/Black, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native American, Hispanic/Latinx, and/or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AAHN). We discuss recommendations for effective IRE programming based on our evaluation and the features found to be particularly salient for AAHN women. The contribution of this work is in describing how a national initiative for IREs builds community and creates conditions known to support persistence of women in computer science.

PATHS has achieved the following major project goals: 1) Increase number of academically talented, low-income students studying CS in Colorado; 4) Increase retention of these students; 3) Establish an active on-campus community to support PATHS scholars and similar students; 4) Engage scholars to perform CS recruitment and outreach at area high schools and community colleges; 5) Evaluate PATHS activities through comparative analysis to provide new insights on best practices for attracting and retaining academically talented, low-income CS students; 6) Broaden participation of historically underrepresented groups in CS; and 7) Develop a new flexible degree program combining other STEM fields and CS. PATHS students are diverse (e.g., 40.8\% from underrepresented groups in computing) and academically successful (e.g., mean GPA is 3.4). Thus far, the program has awarded scholarships to 49 students and retained 93.9\% of the students.

Yet one key set of barriers to doing so can be broadly described as scaling challenges -- in the number and breadth of courses in a curriculum and in the number of students in the CS major. Our paper describes and makes available a novel activity for teaching ethics using role-play that has advantages for scaling across different courses and in different delivery modes, including synchronous and asynchronous online course offerings. We describe our design process and early findings from developing the activity in a large first year seminar course, a senior-level computing and society class, and three different online graduate level courses. Further, we describe an evaluation survey that instructors can use to assess the short-term impact of the activity. We analyze survey results and our direct observations to reflect on the strengths and challenges of the activity. Our experiences suggest that role-play as a pedagogical tool can be particularly useful to broaden student perspectives and meaningfully incorporate ethics into CS courses.","Ben","Rydal","Shapiro","bshapiro@gsu.edu","Learning Sciences","Georgia State University","Atlanta","GA","USA"

In industry, there is a growing awareness of the importance of designing technologies that provide an optimal user experience regardless of the user's ability or impairment. At the university level, this awareness of the need for accessibility minded future technologists has encouraged the incorporation of accessibility and inclusive design content into a wide range of computer science and related courses. Despite this growing awareness, the actual process of teaching students about the needs and perspectives of persons with disabilities remains challenging. Within this paper we report on our experience teaching a graduate course on inclusive design with a specific focus on our experience incorporating a participatory design (PD) activity involving older adults as the course's concluding design activity. While students responded favorably to much of the course's content, learning was enhanced through the design activity which mirrored a real-world project and included three older adult (80+) co-designers. Despite the benefits of PD, students were at times overwhelmed by the workload and the logistical difficulties of working within a remote participatory design process. We believe that a review of our experience and student reflections may prove beneficial to those similarly teaching inclusive design and accessibility.

The growing importance of computing knowledge in most professional fields has led many countries and stakeholders around the world to introduce Computer Science (CS) education in K-12 curriculum. These curricula replace the existing Information Communications Technology (ICT) curriculum by adding a new dedicated CS curriculum, adding topics of CS (predominantly ""programming"") to the ICT curriculum, or providing CS as an additional elective course. This paper aims to describe a new comprehensive curriculum that integrates topics of ICT with CS in a rich context to create need-based learning for the students (year 1 of the 3-year curriculum). The proposed curriculum has been designed to seamlessly replace existing ICT curriculum giving students added proficiency in CS along with ICT. This experience report provides the pedagogy behind the inclusion of ICT and CS topics, the detail of the curriculum, teacher training, and data collection methodology for impact evaluation.

Currently, however, computer science educators have been reluctant to teach AI to non-majors out of concern that the topic is too advanced.  To fill this gap, we propose an AI and machine learning (ML) curriculum that is specifically designed for first-year students. In this paper, we describe our curriculum and show how it covers four key content areas: core concepts, implementation details, limitations, and ethical considerations. We then share our experiences teaching our new curriculum to 174 randomly-selected Freshman students. Our results show that non-computer scientists can comprehend AI/ML concepts without being overwhelmed by the subject material. Specifically, we show that students can  design, code, and deploy their own intelligent agents to solve problems, and that they understand the importance and value of learning about AI in a general-education course.","Adrian","A.","de Freitas","adrian.defreitas@afacademy.af.edu","","United States Air Force Academy","Colorado Springs","CO","USA"

One of their main roles is performing one-on-one tutoring in the computer lab to help students understand and debug their programming assignments. What goes on in the mind of an undergraduate TA when they are helping students with programming? In this experience report, we present firsthand accounts from an undergraduate TA documenting her 36 hours of in-lab tutoring for a CS2 course, where she engaged in 69 one-on-one help sessions. This report provides a unique perspective from an undergraduate's point-of-view rather than a faculty member's. We summarize her experiences by constructing a four-part model of tutoring interactions: a) The tutor begins the session with an initial state of mind (e.g., their energy/focus level, perceived time pressure). b) They observe the student's outward state upon arrival (e.g., how much they seem to care about learning). c) Using that observation, the tutor infers what might be going on inside the student's mind. d) The combination of what goes on inside the tutor's and student's minds affects tutoring interactions, which progress from diagnosis to planning to an explain-code-react loop to post-resolution activities. We conclude by discussing ways that this model can be used to design scaffolding for training novice TAs and software tools to help TAs scale their efforts to larger classes.

Existing studies use records of students' actions in the IDE, consecutive code snapshots, compilation events, and others, to gain deep insight into the process of student programming. 
    
    In this paper, we present a set of tools for collecting and processing data of student activity during problem-solving. The first tool is a plugin for IntelliJ-based IDEs (PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, CLion). By capturing snapshots of code and IDE interaction data, it allows to analyze the process of writing code in different languages --- Python, Java, Kotlin, and C++. The second tool is designed for the post-processing of data collected by the plugin and is capable of basic analysis and visualization. To validate and showcase the toolkit, we present a dataset collected by our tools. It consists of records of activity and IDE interaction events during solution of programming tasks by 148 participants of different ages and levels of programming experience. We propose several directions for further exploration of the dataset.","Elena","","Lyulina","elena.lyulina@jetbrains.com","","JetBrains Research","Saint Petersburg ","","Russian Fed."

Yet, there is a global disparity in where youth are learning programming, with the majority of computing instruction occurring in developed countries and urban areas, if it occurs at all in developing countries. In this work, we sought to counteract this trend by bringing computing, specifically physical computing in the form of robotics, to youth and young adults in rural El Salvador. In this paper, we present the robotics activities completed with youth in a small, Salvadoran community. Based on field notes of the activities and interviews with the youth who participated, we present both the successes and difficulties we faced carrying out this educational outreach program.

An integral part of many degree programs is a capstone experience, where students complete a major research or real-world project at the culmination of their educational program.  In engineering and computer science, many have shown that client-sponsored projects lead to better student engagement and improved training.  In this paper, we discuss experiences with developing an interdisciplinary, client-sponsored capstone program in data science and machine learning.  We show how we set up the capstone program, including how the program is structured, how projects are set up, how the course is managed, how students are assessed, and outline the newly developed capstone curriculum.  Finally, we report results from a cohort of students participating in this capstone program and discuss lessons learned as well as best practices when developing data science capstone programs.","Genevera","I.","Allen","gallen@rice.edu","Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Statistics, and Computer Science","Rice University","Houston","TX","USA"
"PT","ert435","Discrete Math with Programming: A Principled Approach","","7","Discrete mathematics is the foundation of computer science.  It focuses
on concepts and reasoning methods that are studied using math notations.
It has long been argued that discrete math is better taught with
programming, which takes concepts and computing methods and turns them
into executable programs.  What has been lacking is a principled approach
that supports all central concepts of discrete math---especially
predicate logic---and that directly and precisely connects math notations
with executable programs.

This paper introduces such an approach.  It is based on the use of a
powerful language that extends the Python programming language with
proper logic quantification (``for all'' and ``exists some''), as well as
declarative set comprehension (also known as set builder) and aggregation
(e.g., sum and product).  Math and logical statements can be expressed
precisely at a high level and be executed directly on a computer,
encouraging declarative programming together with algorithmic
programming.  We describe the approach, detailed examples, experience in
using it, and the lessons learned.","Yanhong","A.","Liu","liu@cs.stonybrook.edu","Computer Science Department","Stony Brook University","Stony Brook","NY","USA"

Hint Requests in an Intelligent Block-Based Coding Environment","","7","Block-based programming environments are widely used by novices who are learning computer science. However, even in block-based coding environments that have been carefully developed to serve novices, students frequently struggle and require additional support. A promising avenue to provide this support is the use of intelligent tutoring systems, which offer adaptive hints to assist learners. In order to provide students with the adaptive hints they need, we must investigate their help-seeking behaviors and identify patterns surrounding their need for support. In this experience report, we examine data collected from 174 college students in an introductory engineering course, who used an intelligent block-based coding environment to learn computer science. These students made more than 1,000 hint requests, which we represent in two-dimensional space along axes of elapsed time and code completeness. Analysis revealed five major clusters of hint requests, which we further characterized through qualitative examination of the coding trajectories that preceded each hint request. We also analyzed how students? incoming knowledge and perceived computer skill were related to their help-seeking behaviors. Students with higher incoming knowledge requested hints when their code was more complete than students with lower incoming knowledge. Students with high perceived computer skill asked for hints when their code was less complete than those with low perceived computer skill. The results presented here provide insight into student help-seeking behavior in computer science education, informing CS educators and system designers on how best to develop support strategies.","Joseph","B.","Wiggins","jbwiggi3@ufl.edu","","University of Florida","Gainesville","FL","USA"

"PT","ert454","Leveraging Collective Impact to Promote Systemic Change in CS Education","","6","Collective impact is an approach for solving complex social problems at scale. The challenge of broadening participation in computing (BPC) is one such problem. The complexity of BPC is compounded by the decentralized nature of public education, where decisions are made primarily at the state level and subject to interpretation at the district level. As such, diversifying computer science (CS) pathways across the nation requires a systemic approach such as collective impact to engage all of the stakeholders who influence CS education and whose decisions can either facilitate or hinder BPC efforts. This experience report discusses how the collective impact framework has been used to advance the work of the Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance, an NSF funded BPC Alliance focused on states and state policy as the unit of change. We discuss how the five essential features of collective impact (common agenda, shared measurement, mutually reinforcing activities, continuous communication, and backbone support) coalesce to facilitate ECEP?s theory of change. The report highlights specific policy changes that ECEP states have addressed to promote BPC, the flipped accountability that results from a non-hierarchical leadership model, and the challenges of measuring systemic changes as an intermediary to BPC.

In response, the government has enacted a training program for in-service primary school teachers, focusing on changing their perceptions about CT, and showing them how it can be used in classroom. This training program was designed for grades 1-6 and piloted in the capital region during 2018. The program initially focused on coding activities, but was then redesigned to show how CT can be used to help meet the learning objectives of different subjects in the curriculum. The program was then scaled up nationwide. In this experience report, we discuss the outcomes of this program. The training program scaled as intended and we identified positive changes in teacher perceptions about CT, especially among female participants.

"PT","ert470","Novice ? Expert Pair Coaching: Teaching Python in a Pandemic","","5","Novice-Expert Pair Coaching (NEPC) is an approach to synchronously teach programming online. A computer programming educator (the expert) and an individual without prior programming experience (the novice) team up while students observe as the novice learns to code. We call NEPC a ?do-aloud,? technique, as the novice verbalizes while carrying out the expert?s instructions.  This approach was developed to teach Python to rising 8th and 9th grade girls using Zoom. The novice assertively asked clarifying questions, experimented with newly-learned knowledge, and confirmed her new understandings. By being public learners, the novice modeled active learning, and the expert improved his teaching after learning of ambiguity and gaps in his instructions. 
A video analysis of NEPC revealed individual and class advantages to teaching programming using this approach. NEPC slowed down the teaching pace, enabled learners to see the novice?s keystrokes, and let students hear each dialogue between the novice and expert. The NEPC approach exploits a synchronous online format to provide more accessibility to each learner. 
NEPC impacted the class climate by providing a more question-friendly and less intimidating learning environment. Active learning was modeled as being academically disruptive: the novice took risks, made and recovered from mistakes, and respectfully interrupted the expert.  These disruptions were constructive, encouraging students to become active participants, not passive consumers. We thought the resulting assertiveness was particularly important for our target students: Black adolescent girls. Implications for creating a more diverse programming pipeline by recruiting novice learners of diverse backgrounds are discussed in the paper.

We provide a framework for measuring skills demonstrated by students

We also examine several unique aspects of designing such a gamified framework 
(\eg the game itself must be insecure enough to be ``hackable'', but secure enough not to be abused), 
and discuss how the framework was used to expose students to various security concepts. 

We found that our gamified experience heavily engaged students.
We also encountered many pain points during our intervention and 
discovered a number of important aspects of gamified settings that must be 
carefully considered. 
For one, the goals of a semi-structured gamified exercise can
sometimes  lead to learners discovering solutions that do
not meet the desired learning objectives.
Furthermore, The exploratory nature of such exercises can also lead learners
down a rabbit hole that, without a proper ``safety net'', they may not exit.
Finally, complex tasks modeled after real world applications can leave little
room for error, frustrating students and limiting instructors' ability to
accurately assess different levels of skill.
Based on our experience designing this intervention, 
we provide a number of transferable recommendations.
The challenges we faced and the lessons we learned 
can be invaluable to those considering gamification as a cybersecurity education
strategy.

However, current structures and belief systems within the discipline have largely relegated computer science education researchers to the margins. Computer science education researchers are mainly ?lone-wolf? scholars in their departments that participate in CSER in addition to their more widely ?accepted? computer science research. As such, there has been a resistance to offer doctoral programs in CSER. Florida International University has not only invested inCSER by hiring a CSER tenure-track faculty member, they have also established a School of Computer Science Education and Engineering Education. Despite this investment, one obstacle remains the low visibility and understanding of computer science education research among undergraduate students. This makes establishing are search group of Ph.D. students challenging. In order to combat this obstacle, a four-year program was developed as a dedicated pipeline to the computer science education Ph.D. through a series of research experiences for undergraduates (REU). Summer 2020 consisted of the first cohort of this four year commitment. Given that 2020 was wrought with a series of unprecedented events, this REU was designed and executed virtually.

Despite these efforts, the gender gap has persisted, with less than a quarter of CS Bachelor?s degrees awarded to women in the United States in 2019. As a community, we must strive to improve women?s experiences in CS. This paper describes work conducted at a large research university which has traditionally offered CS1 through lecture sections ranging in size from 400-650 students. In Fall 2019, we offered an alternative small all-women's class (35 students) in addition to the traditional lecture class (601 students; 149 women). Both classes covered the same CS concepts but were led by different instructors. Students reported on their experience through a survey administered at the end of the semester. Students in the all-women?s class reported significantly greater social connections and comfort collaborating with their peers compared to women in the traditional class. They also reported significantly greater feelings of support within their class, more confidence in their CS knowledge, and a more welcoming classroom environment compared to women in the traditional class. Additionally, the drop rate for students in the all-women?s class was significantly lower (5.7\%) than the drop rate for women in the traditional class (24.8\%).

The goal of the skills tests was twofold: (1) to help motivate students to engage in distributed practice and, thus, gain adequate coding skills to be an effective team member during the team project and (2) to accurately assess whether students had acquired the requisite skills and, thereby, catch deficiencies early, while there was still time to address them. Regarding the first goal, although several students indicated that the tests motivated them to engage in substantial practice coding, it was ultimately inconclusive as to the extent of the tests' impact on students' distributed practice behavior and on their preparation for the project. Regarding the second goal, the skills testing approach was indeed considerably more effective than graded homework assignments for assessing coding skill and detecting struggling students early. Lessons learned from our experiences included that students had significant concerns about the strict time limit on the tests, that the tests caused a spike in mid-semester withdrawals from the course that disproportionately impacted students from underrepresented groups, and that detecting struggling students was one thing, but effectively helping them catch up was a whole other challenge.

a course ""Software Development Essentials"", a second year computer science course designed to teach software engineering skills
without a project component. This paper describes the motivation,
design, and implementation of the course.
This course was offered as a pilot course that enrolled approximately 65 students at the University of Virginia. The need for the
course emerged as we found many later project-centric courses
assumed students already had knowledge and skills related to build
configuration, database usage, design, version control, and incremental development, despite none of them materials being covered
in our intro programming sequence. Further, in the project-centric
software engineering course (typically a third-year course), students often were expected to start on a project before concepts such
as design principles, design patterns, and incremental development
were covered. Thus, students were often learning these principles
and techniques after they had already been working on a project
for weeks, and often too late to implement these into the project
naturally.
This course is not intended to replace a software engineering
course. Rather, this course is intended to prepare students for future
project courses, including a software engineering course. In this
paper, we describe our experience designing and delivering this
course in the Spring semester 2020. We review both student and

The MSP approach involves assigning students several smaller programming assignments per week, for example 5-7, versus the traditional one larger program (OLP) per week. This shift is largely made possible by easy-to-use program auto-graders that have arisen in recent years. Such auto-graders make grading so many programs feasible, while also providing students with immediate feedback. The MSP approach has been shown to yield advantages that include earlier starts, reduced anxiety, increased confidence, the ability to switch to another program if stuck, better exam performance, and less attrition, with analysis showing students easily transition to larger programs later. We desired to gain insight on how our CS1 students were working through our weekly MSPs. Thus, in 2018, we began exploring automated creation of concise representations of student behavior while they developed their programs, what we call ""workflow charts"". We used a popular commercial auto-grader that has a built-in development environment and provides detailed log files of every program compile/run by each student. We describe the goals of such a representation, the evolution of our representation to its current status, various design trade-offs, our current usage, and numerous possible future uses in CS1 classes. We plan to create a website for any instructor to upload such log files to gain insight on their own class' performance.","Joe","Michael","Allen","jalle010@ucr.edu","Computer Science and Engineering","University of California, Riverside","Riverside","CA","USA"

In this paper, we present PlanIT, a guided planning tool integrated with the Snap! programming environment designed to help novices plan and program their open-ended projects.

We report findings from a pilot study of high school students using PlanIT, showing that students who used the tool learned to make more specific and actionable plans. Results from student interviews show they appreciate the guidance that PlanIT provides, as well as the affordances it offers to more quickly create program elements.","Alexandra","","Milliken","aamillik@ncsu.edu","Computer Science","North Carolina State University ","Raleigh","NC","USA"

Navigating this world involves skills ranging from requirements gathering and creative thinking through high-level design and communication. Academic programming experience is frequently based on assignments that are pre-defined in specific, unambiguous language. This approach leaves a skills gap in translating amorphous, ambiguous problem scenarios into specifications. Video scenarios are a flexible, ready-to-use tool to aid in developing the skills needed to fill this gap. The short videos show individuals discussing or experiencing situations for which they need computing assistance. However, the situations are presented in ways that are ambiguous, open-ended, and sometimes contradictory. Students must utilize critical listening, observation, and thinking skills to define the problem the characters are experiencing and design potential solutions. Video scenarios can be easily used to develop requirements gathering, design specification, and communication skills in classes ranging from general education through capstone seminars. They are particularly well suited for software engineering and design courses, including those in certificate programs. By putting a face on a problem, video scenarios highlight the role of the user and provide a setting for developing user stories, use cases, and interaction skills integral to agile development. Student feedback from using video scenarios in a software engineering course is also presented.

"PT","ert548","Programming for Children and Teenagers in Brazil: A 5-year Experience of an Outreach Project","","7","There has been a worldwide surge in programming education initiatives for children and teenagers. In Brazil, this trend faces some challenges, namely inadequate infrastructure of most schools, notably public ones, that lack access to computers and tablets, and basic education curricular requirements not contemplating computer science concepts. This article reports on the five-year experience of an outreach project from a public university in Brazil. The project aims to promote computer science education and to teach programming to children and teenagers.
Undergraduate engineering students who participate in the project as members engage in activities such as planning the courses and their schedules, creating partnerships with local schools and other educational projects, giving lectures, producing scientific research and educational materials, as well as promoting the project on social media. The courses use free online programming tools, Python, MIT App Inventor, and Arduino to cover fundamental concepts of programming and computational thinking. They vary approaches and tools according to the age range and available technological resources of the target audience. The use of unplugged activities means to assist in learning and to circumvent computer access problems. Furthermore, they serve for introducing basic programming concepts in classes and motivating students with dynamic activities. Over its five-year existence, the project has achieved its purpose, by reaching a total of 2639 students through 45 workshops and 94 courses. It has provided courses in eleven public schools, created two booklets and one app as free educational material, along with presented papers and posters in scientific conferences.","Andr?","","Branco","abrancomrafaels@gmail.com","","Federal University of Rio de Janeiro","Maca?","","Brazil"

However, some of them face challenges to implement these initiatives due to the lack of computers and the high cost of educational robotics kits. This experience report presents an affordable robotics course for teaching programming basic concepts in primary schools without infrastructure such as internet access or computer labs. The project-based learning approach is applied in the course and it encourages students to be more proactive in their learning as well as working in teams. The used methodology combined with educational robotics can provide meaningful learning experiences to the students, avoiding mere replication tasks. Three different projects are proposed: traffic light, drawbridge and smart home. Each group develops a project during the classes. In the last class, all of them are assembled to build a prototype of a village with streets, houses, traffic lights and bridges. This course was held in two Brazilian primary schools with no computer lab. A total of 54 students engaged this experience. A survey applied in the end of the course showed that nearly 90% of the students appreciated the robotics projects and wanted to learn more about programming. Instructors reported that with low-cost robotics kits and one computer per 8 students, the class were able to develop all activities of the course. They also emphasize that the project-based learning approach encouraged students' creativity while learning robotics and programming. This experience contributes to mitigating barriers to implement programming and robotic courses independently of schools infrastructure.

In this paper we present results from an intervention we piloted in a text mining special topics class. This intervention is directly applicable to any data mining class. Students applied naive Bayes classification to a survey result dataset and classified responses as ""technical"" or ?equity"", where technical meant the survey question response was focused on technical issues, whereas ?equity? meant the response was focused on DEI issues. The survey data came from another course where students watched Ms. Joy Buolamwini's 2016 ""How I'm fighting bias in algorithms"" TedX talk and then answered several survey questions about the talk. In our text mining course students were first asked to watch the same TedX talk and answer several of the same survey questions.  Their answers were added to the original data set.  Students were then asked to apply naive Bayes classification to the combined survey results for one question. At the end of the course students took an end of class survey and answered more open-ended questions about whether the assignment influenced their thinking about DEI in computing. Results from this intervention indicate that including a DEI focus in technical programming assignments can positively impact students' views on the importance of DEI and contribute to the development of computing and engineering professional mindsets.","Scott","T.","Leutenegger","leut@du.edu","Computer Science Department","University of Denver","Denver","CO","USA"

Marketed to 6th-12th graders who identify as female, SGWC aims to (1) introduce participants to the fundamentals of computing, (2) contextualize computing in modern life, (3) improve participants? confidence and attitudes toward computing, and (4) foster an inclusive, supportive, and welcoming learning environment. Toward these ends, MSU students serve as near-peer mentors, guiding participants in active learning, collaborative learning, project-based learning and culturally-relevant computing activities. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, SGWC was forced to abruptly transition to virtual meetings after the first five in-person meetings of the spring 2020 session. Club attendance fell in the immediate wake of Michigan public school closures by about 50%. But retention and morale of those who attended the first virtual session was high. Moreover, feedback from those who completed SGWC and their parents indicate overall satisfaction with the virtual adaptation of SGWC and support that it was successful in achieving its goals. This paper highlights lessons distilled over the course of SGWC?s transition to a virtual format. Our goal is to provide a vision for the post-pandemic role of out-of-school time coding clubs in the diversification and development of future computer scientists.","Andrew","","McDonald","mcdon499@msu.edu","Department of Computer Science and Engineering","Michigan State University","East Lansing","MI","USA"

Although Black female students have participated in AP CSP at higher rates than for the AP CSA course, their representation is still disproportionately lower than the school population of Black females. In this Experience Report, we present the early results of an NSF-sponsored effort that provides an AP CSP preparatory experience and CS career awareness to Black female students from rural, urban, and suburban communities in the state of Alabama.

At the project?s core is a peer-learning community (PLC) facilitated by Black female teachers with deep knowledge of AP CSP. An intensive summer experience prepares students for the AP CSP course through culturally-responsive, project-based learning experiences designed to connect advanced computing concepts to the students? personal lives and career aspirations. Interactions and support continue throughout the academic year to facilitate AP exam readiness. Online interactions among the PLC members serve to mitigate the barriers that young women of color typically encounter when pursuing CS education, increasing their persistence and success in CS.

We examined whether students? project participation enhances self-efficacy and perceived competency in CS, increases positive attitudes, awareness, and desire to pursue CS studies and careers, and mitigates perceived socio-cultural barriers to pursue studies and careers in CS. Our initial findings include AP CSP examination qualifying rates (87.5%) that numerically exceeded the 2020 national/statewide rates for all groups (i.e., based on race, gender, and their intersection), increased perceptions of Black females as belonging in CS, and gains in computing self-efficacy.","Martha","","Escobar","marthaescobar@oakland.edu","Department of Psychology","Oakland University","Richmond","MI","USA"

During the time of COVID-19 we offered a free CS1 class to people around the world. Well-aware of the high drop-out rates reported in many massive open-access online courses (MOOCs), we augmented our course with a scalable, human-centered solution: <i>section leading.</i> Section leaders teach small, weekly interactive learning sessions. We hypothesize that the personalized attention adds a sense of responsibility for both student and teacher which drives learning. We recruited over 900 volunteer section leaders and more than 10,000 students in the class. To our knowledge this is the largest group of section leaders in a single CS1 course offering and the most small group interactions. The completion rate in our class was more than 10 times that usually reported for similar MOOCs. Additionally, 99% of the volunteer section leaders taught through the entire span of the course, showing the potential for large scale volunteer-driven education, and the benefit that teachers themselves derive. We also discovered the potential for replication of this model, as 34\% of students in a representative-sample survey indicated they would serve as section leaders for a future offering of the course. This level of participation would be more than sufficient to field additional offerings of the course sustainably. We believe this is an intriguing case study of a model for significantly scaling human-centric CS education for all.

We are at the cusp of a new focus for tool research and development, and this presentation proposes a vision for the next generation of teaching tools, using automated program assessment as an example for how our tools should evolve.</par><par>Beginning in the 1960s, the first generation of automated program grading tools focused on <i>workflow automation.</i> Automating the processing of student work to increase the speed and accuracy of mechanical steps would reduce the time human graders spend on these tasks, allowing them to be more effective at the more meaningful aspects of grading. After mastering automation, the second generation of autograders focused on <i>assessment</i>--specifically, increasingly better strategies for evaluating the quality and correctness of student work. The last two decades have seen significant work in this area, resulting in a change in terms to ""automated program assessment tools.""</par><par>Now, we are beginning to see a new focus emerge, which will lead to a new generation of tools for teaching and learning. While assessing the final product that a student creates is the essence of the ""grading"" task, our goal as educators is not to grade, but to teach. One great benefit of automated program assessment tools is that they provide feedback to students with the aim of helping students to improve their work and to <i>learn.</i> Indeed, the assessment tool and the student form a closed-loop feedback system, and we should not ignore the role the human plays in that system. It is not enough to objectively and accurately assess the work product--we must consider how the feedback itself and the way it is delivered affect the student's experience, with the goal of contributing to student learning. The student's experience in receiving feedback can affect their beliefs, their motivation, and their behavior.</par><par>Instead of focusing primarily on the work product (the solution being produced), tool researchers need to broaden their perspectives to adopt specific goals for student learning that their tools will promote. Improving self-efficacy, encouraging a growth mindset, encouraging students who are challenged, recognizing accomplishments, and fostering active engagement are all aspects a human grader may consider when providing feedback by hand, and the same concerns should inform the design of automated feedback. A holistic view of how the feedback affects the learner is essential. As a result, I advocate moving from a tool-centric perspective toward designing complete learning experiences, where the student interacting with a teaching tool through feedback is explicitly considered. The primary goal is to foster targeted changes in specific beliefs, behaviors, skills, and knowledge in the student, rather than just to ""grade"" their work. By focusing on the student experience and the intended changes (or learning or growth) in the student as the goal, we can reframe the nature of ""assessment"" tools in a way that will change our outlook on what can be accomplished.","Stephen","H.","Edwards","edwards@cs.vt.edu","Department of Computer Science","Virginia Tech","Blacksburg","VA","USA"

The ubiquitous connectivity of devices and ever-connected students drives the need for cybersecurity education at a deeper and more technical level than in any previous generation. 
The High School Cybersecurity Curriculum Guidelines (HSCCG) were developed using the Principles of Curriculum for Understanding (National Research Council, 2002) and the Backward Design methodology (Wiggins and McTighe, 2005).  The National Research Council (2002) principles call for curriculum to be developed based on  the organizing principles of the domain, depth of understanding, models of inquiry and truth verification in the field, and connections that allow students to tether school learning with real-world application.  Backward Design is a methodology for expressing curriculum in alignment with the National Research Council Principles.  These methodologies were explicitly chosen because they are grounded in research on human learning (National Research Council, 2002). The High School Cybersecurity Curriculum Guidelines (HSCCG) express the knowledge domain for secondary level cybersecurity learning, and are being used to support high school courses, teacher professional development, and the development of instructional materials.
This talk will briefly introduce the curriculum guidelines and share educational resources and lesson plans based on the HSCCG.  For additional information, to sign up for the mailing list, and access the courseware, please visit https://TeachCyber.Org.

Recently, a new machine learning program have been integrated into the Israeli high school computer science curriculum and thus we added a new machine learning module to the Methods of Teaching Computer Science (MTCS) course, which is part of the teachers? preparation program. This machine learning module provides us a unique opportunity to teach both pedagogy and content with the same subject matter. After teaching the basics of machine learning, we asked the students to find similarities between human learning theories and machine learning algorithms. Students identified several interesting parallels: (a) Supervised learning is similar to behavioral learning as the machine learns to connect training examples (stimuli) with labels (behavior). Also, the learning is based on minimizing error (punishment) function, (b) Reinforcement learning is similar to behavioral learning as learning is based on feedback from the environment, (c) Constructivism can be identified in the iterative convergence of the algorithm; the inner model improves each iteration based on the current knowledge, and (d) Social learning is reflected in clustering as each cluster affects the learning of the other clusters. In our talk, we present the idea that computational mental models may be used to reinforce pedagogical mental models and vice versa.

AI identity: AI understanding, using an ethics and societal impact lens, community building, and leadership development. To carry out these four pillars, we use six pedagogical building blocks to design quality curriculum materials. These building blocks include: utilizing active learning and universal design for learning principles, developing students? data literacy and AI impact analysis skills, and exposing students to diverse job descriptions, applications, and role models within the field of AI. These building blocks ensure that, though our curricular materials are developed for different audiences with differing levels of experience with AI or coding, we are able to standardize a high level of pedagogical quality across all materials. These pillars and building blocks have been developed through literature review and discussion with AI/CS researchers and professionals working in AI. In this talk, we will show how these curricula were implemented in three different settings: (1) a pilot collegiate-level workshop, (2) an intensive multi-week high school summer program, and (3) a free online platform openly available to high school teachers and students.

"PT","lt817","Considering the Effects of Computer Scientist Stereotypes on Student Mental Health","","1","Despite the research, reports, and testimonials that document mental health issues among Computer Science (CS) students, little exploration has been done on how the stereotypes associated with CS affect the mental health of its participants. This lightning talk investigates how computer scientist stereotypes contribute to experiences of mental distress. Such investigation helps fill the present gap in our understanding of why students may be susceptible to symptoms of mental illness. Computer scientist stereotypes have long served as barriers for entry into the field, and its many facets ? technology-oriented obsession, innate genius, social awkwardness, unattractive physical appearance, and masculinity ? contribute to mental health issues within students. It is therefore critical to generate awareness on the negative consequences of perpetuating these stereotypes. Consideration of this topic includes academic literature, reports, articles, essays, and personal narratives, which collectively point to experiences of anxiety, depression, insecurity, lack of belonging, and emotional stress. With a need to strengthen this hypothesis through empirical experimentation and computational study, interested faculty and students are invited to attend the presentation and participate in the exchange of ideas, so that this hypothesis may be confirmed and to inspire future hypotheses. Ultimately, this research encourages institutions and members to challenge existing stereotypical norms, open the dialogue surrounding mental health, conduct further research on wellbeing, and better support members of the CS community.","Francesca","","Vera","fvera@alumni.stanford.edu","","Stanford University","Stanford","CA","USA"
"PT","lt826","A Microlearning Online Framework for Teaching Programming Basics","","1","This lightning talk describes the authors? initiative to deliver effective and enjoyable online learning of programming-basics to middle-school and beyond students with no programming background. With the COVID-19 long-term implications that have driven school systems to online learning, students face new challenges as they struggle to maintain their focus during long online sessions, with some experiencing physical impacts (e.g., ?zoom fatigue?). Microlearning, a set of small (5-8 min of length) learning units targeting small learning objectives and usually delivered online, appears as a promising direction for educators to face these challenges. However, because of its fragmented nature, and difficulty to provide immediate ?value-based? feedback to the learner, it is hard to apply microlearning in complex domains such as Computer-Science and programming.  We are looking to develop a task-driven online microlearning environment for learning programming-basics. The environment will include motivating microtasks as well as formative feedback per microlearning unit.  In a pilot study, we included short recorded lectures and project-driven activities. For the learning Integrated Development Environment (IDE) we used the application Tinkercad, which enables building programmable electronic devices. This learning IDE enabled the students to exercise ?micro-projects? (involving software and simulated hardware) in which their code had to ?operate? electronic device. We believe this concept can inspire a pedagogical framework that utilizes Microlearning for teaching programming and we will welcome the audience's input.","Amit","","Palti","amit.palti@campus.technion.ac.il","","Technion - Israel Institute of Technology","Haifa","","Israel"

The CoLab.online web application is designed to give project-based instructors the data and support they need to help their students develop the skills necessary for success. It?s feature set includes weekly self- and peer-assessment with the results plotted on interactive charts for the instructor. It is interesting because it focuses students on reporting on the groups? internal dynamics rather than on evaluating their peers. A unique linked-slider interface makes the zero-sum approach clear by driving teammates sliders proportionally in the opposite direction of the one being moved. Furthermore, students are asked to assess their groups on a weekly basis, offering instructors a comprehensive picture, plotted on interactive graphs to help identify which teams are struggling such that the instructor can focus their team support efforts on teams that most need their help. The talk aims to enlist collaborators interested in developing our students? collaborative skills.

"PT","lt854","Reflective Debugging with a Python Web IDE","","0","In this lightning talk, we explore the impact of adding reflective debugging to a web-based problem-solving IDE, Spinoza, that we created to support teaching programming with Python. Spinoza allows the instructor to create (or select from a library) Python problems with automatic unit tests. Each time a student attempts a new problem, the system randomly decides if reflective debugging will be required; in which case each time the student runs their code and the code does not pass the unit tests, the student will be required to classify the type of error (syntax, logic or runtime error), provide a description of the bug, and explain how they plan to fix it before they are allowed to revise and run the code again. Our main result from this pilot study is that the number of debugging steps to reach a correct solution was statistically significantly less when students were required to use reflective debugging. Our hope was that by being required to analyze each error for some problems (about one out of three), students would see the benefits and develop the habit of reflective debugging even when it was not required.","Fatima","","Abu Deeb","deebf@ksau-hs.edu.sa","","King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences","Ahsa","","Saudi Arabia"

"PT","lt855","Investigating the Role of Computing in General Education Requirements","","0","General education requirements delineate the core requirements that all students of a particular university must complete in order to graduate. These requirements are often indicative of how an institution views its core mission, leading to vastly different requirements at schools serving different student populations. Among institutions with a computing requirement, the expectations vary widely; some schools mandate programming courses for all students, while others require only a computer literacy course.
As movements like CS for All seek to increase students? exposure to computing, potentially affecting general education requirements, it would be beneficial for universities to have a clear picture of what computing requirements exist and how common they are. We therefore propose an analysis to address the question of what computing?s role is in the general education requirements of 4-year institutions in the United States. How common are computing requirements in the general education requirements? What is the nature of the requirement (e.g., programming vs. computer literacy)? How do these requirements differ by institutional profile?
We plan to analyze the course catalogues and general education requirements of approximately 100 randomly selected institutions. We will collect data on requirements that reference computing, including the number of courses or credits required in computing and in the entire general education core. We also plan to record specific courses that satisfy the computing requirement, as well as recommended courses for completing the requirement when the catalog contains such information.

"PT","lt904","Some Bridges Span More than Water: Engaging High School Java Learners with Data Structure Visualizations and Real-World Data","","1","Many high school mathematics teachers have stepped up to the charge of learning computer science and offering CS courses to their students. As CS grows in popularity, more students are completing AP CS A as sophomores or juniors, and looking for advanced opportunities while still in high school.

Our project seeks to support high school teachers in their quests to meet students' needs for advanced CS coursework. I am one such teacher who faced that need, and was relieved to find the BRIDGES libraries and projects repository website for CS college professors. I began the work of adapting their data structures related projects for use in my courses. Solving Java programming challenges using BRIDGES libraries has helped my students visualize and program with one- and two-dimensional arrays and linked lists. 

In this talk, we encourage/recruit high school teachers to try our adapted-for-high-school BRIDGES materials, and share in the joy of cool visualizations that make data structures come alive. Using one sample project, I will show how an engaging problem, scaffolded learning materials, and dynamic visualizations converge to facilitate student understanding of, and programming agility with, two-dimensional arrays.

However, when we try to go beyond standard thinking, it turns out that the debates can be a great educational tool in telecommunication and computer engineering. Oxford-style debating can be defined as a formal communication process where participants argue for and against a predetermined topic, known as a motion. The discussion has a competitive format where the participants are divided into two teams: proponents, who agree with the motion of debate, and opponents, who argue against the motion. The participants ? including the listening rest of the class ? take a broad view of the given subject without ignoring different points of view. This form of debating supports professional education and soft skills training, efficient teamwork and individual study, and effective verbal and non-verbal communication skills. All of these abilities are very important for IT engineers. The well-organized structure and competitive character makes this educational tool useful in academic study (especially for postgraduate students) as well as at special events (e.g. summer schools). Defining valid and interesting motions is certainly a challenge; however, given sufficient interest and research, there are plenty of topics suitable for a valuable debate related to computer science (e.g. ?Law enforcement agencies should be able to read confidential messages sent by citizens?). Oxford-style debates can be a great didactic tool at technical universities.","Marcin","","Niemiec","niemiec@agh.edu.pl","","AGH University of Science and Technology","Krakow","","Poland"
"PT","lt993","The Big Pixel Microworld","","1","Microworlds are sandboxed learning environments, often used for a particular educational purpose. We introduce the Big Pixel Microworld, to allow young students to explore and visualize functions that operate on the discrete ?pixels? of the XY coordinate axes. They can change the size of a ?pixel? by 3x (a single 1x1 big ?pixel?, or 3x3, 9x9, 27x27 grids etc. all the way down to 729x729, in which one displayed ?pixel? is one screen pixel).

There are two modes: zooming and resolution. For some problems, zooming is better, in which the pixels remain fixed to the background function, and what is displayed appears as if the user is zooming in on a camera. We also feature resolution mode, in which we clamp the edges of the screen to the background function, and increasing the number of pixels on the screen appears as if the user is sampling the space higher.

There are four distinct activities in this microworld: Paint, Function Exploration, Cellular Automata, and Color Exploration. We have used this microworld at our outreach events and in our Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) Middle School course, and have had very positive responses, but are looking for other ideas. What other spaces should we explore with this tool? What other microworlds should we build? What have others built? The goal of this lightning talk is to engage the SIGCSE community with this preliminary work and share best practices and ideas for possible future work.

An Interdisciplinary Course Connecting Computing and Theatre Arts","","1","The success of performing arts productions has typically relied to varying degrees on technology and its associated innovations. Imaginative set construction and creative lighting design provide the necessary environment to transport viewing audiences effectively in both time and place.

This new course entitled ?Digital Theatre Design? is an interdisciplinary effort to awaken students in Theatre Arts and Computer Science to the exceptional learning experience of collaborating across traditional boundaries that exist between the Arts and Engineering. While pursuing their degrees, undergraduate students majoring in STEM fields typically have limited exposure to the extensive variety of career paths available to them. Students taking this course benefit greatly from the opportunity to consider potential careers that effectively integrate both humanities and technology and to raise awareness about the breadth of the possible applications of computing in modern society.

Offered in Spring 2020, this course encourages students to investigate the interplay of artistry and technology as they work together to ultimately design and present scenes from selected plays, which represents the capstone project for the course. Students are given an introduction to the ?tools? of the trade in a studio setting as they advance through a series of exercises, as well as independent and team projects focusing on both artistic design and software engineering. This poster presentation will display in detail the classroom strategies, course activities, and future plans for this innovative course offering.

However, a majority of high schools still do not offer computer science. While in-school programs can provide more equitable access to computing, these types of programs are not available to every student. To supplement national efforts, our university created a community outreach organization to provide opportunities to the local community. The organization creates opportunities for middle and high school students to learn different topics in computing with the main goal of increasing confidence. The primary program we offer is a two-hour tech camp, which explores a particular topic in computing. In this poster, we look to discover how tech camps affect confidence in computing. We identify which age groups are most positively affected by tech camps as well as what topics are most effective. We also discuss our methods for gathering data, our analysis of data, and how our findings will be used in future programming.","Sydney","","Leither","sleither17@bw.edu","Computer Science","Baldwin Wallace University","Berea","OH","USA"

This work explores the root cause of this phenomenon as understood by Texas teachers who are part of an NSF supported networked improvement community (NIC) focused on gender disparities. Using teacher-defined problem statements about the root cause of gender disparities, we uncovered 15 subcodes across six main attributions for the underrepresentation of female students. Teachers overwhelmingly described student-related issues, such as awareness and lack of role models, as the primary driver of gender disparities. We found that teachers? attributions of the root cause of gender disparities varied based on teacher gender and teacher experience.","Thyra","","Tuttle","ttuttle@sagefoxgroup.com","","SageFox Consulting Group","Amherst","MA","USA"

Introductory computing theory can be challenging for undergraduate students, and the overarching goal of our research is to help students learn these computational models.  The most common pedagogical tool for interacting with these models is the Java Formal Languages and Automata Package (JFLAP).  We developed a JFLAP server extension, which accepts homework submissions from students, evaluates the submission as correct or incorrect, and provides a witness string when the submission is incorrect.  Our extension currently provides witness feedback for deterministic finite automata, nondeterministic finite automata, regular expressions, context-free grammars, and pushdown automata.

In Fall 2019, we ran a preliminary investigation on two synchronized sections (Control and Study) of the required undergraduate course Introduction to Computer Science Theory.  The Study section ($n=29$) used our extension for five targeted homework questions, and the Control section ($n=35$) submitted these problems using traditional means.  The Study section strongly outperformed the Control section with respect to the percent of perfect homework grades for the targeted homework questions.  Our most interesting result was student persistence: with only the short witness string as feedback, students voluntarily persisted in submitting attempts until correct.

This project sought to answer a question: is there a need for a more robust system of networking and resources for computer science education (CSEd) graduate students? The large response to initial community-building efforts indicates that this is likely the case. In just over one year, a global community of 190 graduate students and 90 CS faculty researchers and advisors have registered for a CSEd graduate focused community. Participant funding, while originally intended for in-person conference attendance and face-to-face meetings, has enabled this project to create study groups attended by 73 students and a virtual conference with 101 participants. These activities were established as a result of a needs assessment survey conducted in early 2020.

Automated systems are appealing to address scalability issues and provide personalized feedback to students. Many of the current approaches fail to handle flexible grading schemes and low-level feedback regarding (a set of) program statements. The combination of program static analysis in the form of program dependence graphs and approximate graph comparisons is promising to address the previous shortcomings. Current techniques require pairwise comparisons of student programs that does not scale in practice. We explore techniques to learn models that are able to recognize whether an unseen program statement belong to a semantically-similar set of program statements. Our initial results on a publicly-available introductory programming assignment indicate that it is possible to assign with high accuracy an individual program statement to some of the popular semantically-similar sets, and a large proportion is covered with these, which suggests feedback provided by instructors can be automatically propagated to other student programs.","Mayur","Sunil","Jawalkar","mj8628@rit.edu","","Rochester Institute of Technology","Rochester","NY","USA"

Recent figures from the National Center for Women in Technology show that only 26% of the computing workforce were women.  There is some evidence that demonstrating the ability for computing to accomplish social good may make studying computing more attractive to women and members of other underrepresented groups. This poster presents initial results of a survey of 288 undergraduate students to ascertain preferences for computing domains.

Elevating the social value of computing has been advocated as an approach to increasing the appeal of computing to both women and other underrepresented groups. This poster adds empirical support for that approach. It reports on the analysis of  projects selected by students over four years of a two-semester senior capstone.  In this capstone students select Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities with which to engage.  The students learned about FOSS principles and processes and were introduced to humanitarian FOSS (HFOSS). They completed pre-semester surveys and engaged in a three-stage project selection process.  The types of projects that students considered (FOSS or HFOSS) support the assertion that computing with social value is appealing to both females and students in underrepresented groups. Analysis of pre-semester attitude surveys adds additional insight and suggests further avenues for investigation.","Grant","","Braught","braught@dickinson.edu","","Dickinson College","Carlisle","PA","USA"

Within computer science education, there is an awareness of a growth mindset, but resources to support the use of a growth mindset in the computer science classroom are limited, and faculty development in the use of growth mindset in the classroom is rare.  Researchers have developed a framework for a computer science growth mindset classroom, which includes faculty development, lesson plans, and vocabulary for use with students.  In addition, the faculty have formed a community of practice which identifies areas where growth mindset techniques can be used and has implemented these strategies in their classrooms.  The framework and materials developed are presented here, with early results from this ongoing work.  The objective is to determine if faculty development on growth mindset and active use of the framework for a growth mindset classroom results in superior academic outcomes in CS0 and CS1. Preliminary results are for faculty in both face-to-face and virtual classroom environments.","Patricia","","Morreale","pmorreal@kean.edu","Computer Science","Kean University","Union","NJ","USA"

"PT","p0925","Landscape of Computer Science Teacher Qualification Pathway","","1","Despite the growing demand for computer science (CS) education for K-12 students, one of the most significant barriers to schools offering CS courses is the lack of certified teachers [1]. According to a report by Code.org [2], only a few states have initial CS certification teacher pathways resulting in differences among the types of qualification pathways. The lack of consistent and clear information is confusing for teachers, school districts, and advocacy groups. One of the challenges of creating a clear understanding of computer science teacher certification in the United States is that certificates can have many meanings, and definitions differ from state to state [3]. This study gathers nationwide data of all the pathways to teach computer science to create definitions for the multitude of CS credential pathways and demonstrates the spectrum of credential pathways.

The first round of data collection focused on identifying the requirements for obtaining a CS credential from the state's board of education website and other CS advocacy websites. The second round of data collection included email correspondence with certification or CS education professionals for the states where information was not easily accessible or clear. After the data was organized into the three defined CS qualified teaching pathways, the computer science certification professionals in all 50 states were emailed to member-check the categories and pathways for their respective state. The research team identified the following three qualification categories and defined the term as seen below.
Initial Licensure: Pre-service teachers can teach CS by getting initial certification from a university/college or other institution (Required BA or BS, Passing test, or others).
Add-on Licensure: Through a test (e.g., Praxis, Pearson, or state test), PD, or other requirements, Preservice or in-service teachers who already have certification/licensure can teach CS by adding CS licensure.
Authorization: Legally allowed to teach CS, the educator does not need to prove CS knowledge. Another subject teacher and subject matter expert (not certified teacher) can be authorized.
We found 19 states have an initial licensure pathway, 44 have add-on licensure, 22 have an authorization pathway, and 3 states did not have any computer science credential policy. There were also different levels of complexity in each category, making it much easier to receive a credential in some states than others.
This study gathered nationwide data on all the pathways to teach CS. It highlights the discrepancies in terminology, making cohesion, and gathering information difficult for teachers wishing to teach computer science. Several states are doing exemplary creating policies for in-service teachers to easily access CS teaching qualifications. These types of add-on or authorization policies can serve as examples for states who do not have initial certification programs yet want to provide computer science education to students.","Jiyoung","","Kim","jk142@iu.edu","","Indiana University","Bloomington","IN","USA"

Pre and post training surveys from the 2019 summer cohort revealed teachers made statistically significant gains in CS content knowledge, confidence in teaching CS, confidence in learning CS, motivation to learn CS, and knowledge of engaging students in CS. C-START  professional development trainings are offered each year based on educator requests, such as Beauty and Joy of Computing, Mobile CSP, Java Programming, Web Programming, Snap!, CS Unplugged, and Introduction to Cryptography. Synergystically, the C-START program has hosted the National CSPdWeek three times featuring Bootstrap and Exploring Computer Science. C-START has had a significant positive impact in Colorado CS high school education. For example, in 2015, a year before C-START began, only 170 high school students in Colorado took the AP CS A exam and only 15.4\% of those students were female. In 2018, 791 high school students took the AP CS A exam in Colorado and 20.6\% of the exam takers were female. Similar positive outcomes exist for students from other underrepresented groups (e.g., from 7.3\% to 21.3\% for Hispanic/Latino). While C-START is not the only PD opportunity for Colorado teachers, we are confident that C-START is helping more Colorado students access CS education.

For example, the Chinese education ministry has integrated AI into the mandatory high school curriculum, including a pilot textbook to teach students about the fundamental AI technologies like deep learning and recognition. However, there are fewer examples of AI education at the primary level, and these are typically focused on decision-making, machine learning, and programming. We have recently started to develop our own elementary AI curriculum. To develop the curriculum, we first needed to explore what students already knew about AI. Although there are a few small studies on how primary students conceptualize AI, we conducted a study to examine how 10 nine- and ten-year-old students conceptualized artificial intelligence by focusing on two main questions: (1) How do elementary students conceptualize artificial intelligence? (2) What are elementary students' experiences with artificial intelligence? Students? definitions of AI tended to focus on programming and robotics. Students described examples of AI that included robotic vacuums, Siri/Alexa, YouTube, and search engines. They also showcased some misconceptions around AI designs and implementations.","Anne","","Ottenbreit-Leftwich","aleftwic@indiana.edu","Instructional Systems Technology ","Indiana University","Bloomington","IN","USA"

To reduce this gap, promote gender diversity in computing and retain students, a mentorship program was created within a computing program in a university with high research activity in the southeastern US. In this program, women undergraduate CS students are paired with corporate mentors for career guidance and support. This study focuses on understanding students' experiences, including transfer students, when participating in this mentorship program. The women transfer students' perspectives are especially critical as there are a limited number of studies highlighting their experiences, which may vary from traditional women students. In spring 2020, we implemented an IRB-approved phenomenology study. We conducted semi-structured interviews with five women undergraduate CS students, among which four were transfer students. The inductive analysis of the data shows that the mentorship program impacted students? personal as well as professional spaces. Within each of these spaces, students are impacted by the program, their mentors, and their peers in the program.

Broad research in teacher education has demonstrated that teacher dispositions are an important driver of teacher motivation, professional choices, and classroom practices. Identification and measurements of teacher dispositions enables further analysis of how teacher beliefs may support or hinder effective practice in CS instruction, how teacher populations may differ, and how identified dispositions may change with exposure to various CS learning experiences. We analyzed 17 key documents produced by 12 national CS organizations using a grounded theory methodology to identify desirable attitudes and beliefs associated with CS and the CS education reform movement. The documents included standards, corporate research reports, advocacy tools for CS education, and organizational documents of professional associations for CS and CS Education. The analysis yielded several important dispositional targets for description and measurement in the area of teacher attitudes and beliefs. An analysis of 98 coded segments related to dispositions yielded consensus attitudes and beliefs. Professional documents in CS highlight an equity orientation, a teacher growth mindset, and identify key beliefs regarding (career) outcomes and epistemology of CS. It is possible, based on this analysis, to create a profile of a teacher who demonstrates the attitudes and beliefs of a reform-aligned CS teacher, the CS ``Champion''. Instrument development along these factors is an important next step towards unlocking the analytical power of teacher attitudes and beliefs.","Darcy","","Ronan","ronand@sacredheart.edu","","Sacred Heart University","Fairfield","CT","USA"

Previously, we showed that introductory CS assignments based on various pencil-and-paper puzzles are valuable, but this study was done at a single university. In this poster, we report on propagation of puzzle-based assignments to many universities and collection of the resulting data from these different contexts.  This allows us to study the efficacy of the assignments in these disparate environments. In order to ease adoption at other universities, we are also interested in the experience of the instructors in implementing the assignments in their courses.  Our overall goal is to ""close the feedback loop"" by collecting and analyzing all of this data to improve both their effectiveness and adoptability.  This poster presents details of the deployment and data collection process, including working with the respective IRBs, selecting and implementing the various assignments, collecting student grades and survey responses, and conducting instructor interviews, in the hopes that it will help other educators to more efficiently and effectively close the feedback loop for their own innovations.

Each ECEP state?s K-12 computer science (CS) education journey has been documented during their ECEP membership resulting in over 25,000 digital documents. Over the course of the project it was necessary to track key events, identify trends across states, and maintain consumable records of state progress. A systematic way to collect and track the data is critical to conduct historical and cross-state analyses. In an effort to quantify and categorize, the researchers engaged in a review process of all ECEP reports, artifacts, and other relevant data to develop a system. Relevant and important components were identified in each type of document and assigned codes using ECEP?s Five Stage Model (?a five-step process toward state-level CS education reform?), the Capacity, Access, Participation, and Experience (CAPE) framework (to measure equity in CS education implementation), and specific policies initiatives (alignment with various policy initiatives - Code.org?s ?Nine Policy Ideas to Make CS Fundamental to K?12 Education?). Indiana was identified as a state to conduct an initial, in-depth case study using this process. Indiana?s case will be used as a model to further develop the stories of other ECEP Alliance member states. Through the development of a data dashboard, we hope to organize all of this information to make it more easily accessible for review and further analysis. The ECEP data dashboard development is currently in progress.","Minji","","Jeon","jeonmin@iu.edu","","Indiana University","Bloomington","IN","USA"

That Is the Question","","1","While preparing students for careers upon graduation, faculty often have to manage the priorities of bridging the gap between the level of student preparation and the expected level of preparedness. The prioritization of these tasks is influenced by discipline and industry specific guidelines and does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery of the tool. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This presentation seeks to challenge the notion that the use of version control systems improves HBCU students? computational thinking (CT) skills and in turn prepares them for careers beyond graduation. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms.

"PT","p0970","Pedagogical Possibilities of Critical Engagement in Introductory CS Education","","1","Computer science holds the unfortunate distinction, at least historically, as a pragmatic and often non-critical domain of practice ? in terms of both theory and praxis. Nonetheless, we are witnessing a growing allegiance to \textit{AI and data ethics} in both academia and industry, and purportedly, 200 university curricula claim to have complied with tech ethics \cite{fiesler2018tech}. This proliferation is a promising step forward and can be a useful corrective against discriminatory consequences concerning algorithmic systems, particularly in technical fields like CS and AI, where ethical issues are not discursively and normatively foregrounded. However, these efforts are more coordinated with conventional business ethics than more critical traditions of social justice \cite{greene2019better} expected to prevail in educational settings \cite{o2016weapons}. It is required of educational systems to enable students to improve their technological sensibilities and skill sets to generate alternative possibilities that would challenge technocratic ideologies that are uncritical and limit innovation to the measures of efficiency and marketability. 

Nudged by these concerns and energized by the creative possibilities of a classroom, we realize the integration of the critical and social dimensions of computing technologies into introductory CS courses as a key area of attention and propose a pedagogical approach largely through concepts that have their legacies in intersectional feminist activism, collective organizing \cite{d2020data}, and critical theory \cite{kellner2003toward}. As reflected in the results from the surveys, this approach has resonated with \%$95.4$ of the studied group of students.

One of the benefits of a BBPL is removing the necessity to recall the syntax rules of a language. However, the visual nature of these languages makes learning and creating code difficult for children with visual impairments and blindness (VIB). Although a few BBPLs were designed for children with VIB, such environments are rarely used by sighted children. Therefore, to investigate the requirements for designing and implementing an accessible blocks-based programming environment that can be used by both students with and without VIB, we developed a BBPL environment for middle school children. The environment consists of a two-dimensional grid where a character can be moved by creating a simple blocks program. Our future plans include performing several empirical experiments to evaluate our BBPL, including the educational impact of the environment on all students and accessibility support for students with VIB. To perform the study, we also plan to prepare lessons for training the students. The results of the study will inform the design of future BBPL environments, as well as contribute toward broadening participation in computing by enabling children with visual impairments to participate fully in CS education opportunities.","Moumita","","Tabassum","mtabassum1@crimson.ua.edu","Department of Computer Science","University of Alabama","Tuscaloosa","AL","USA"

Sarah Hug, CERC
Contact: hug@colorado.edu

Establishing a growth mindset in academic learning is known to influence student outcomes, yet little is known about how faculty communicate their growth mindset beliefs, or how these beliefs translate into classroom practices. Studies of a ?growth mindset pedagogy? exist in K12 learning environments but few have studied how faculty convey messages of malleable intelligence through their teaching. Interviews related to faculty practices were held electronically in April of 2020 via telephone and Zoom, were recorded, and transcribed. All of the data were coded with an eye towards fixed and growth mindset, no matter the direct content of the question being asked. For example, a statement that related to how a faculty member supports struggling students could be coded ?fixed mindset-computing is not for everyone? if the response indicates the instructor might suggest a change in major. Alternatively, if a faculty member stated they would recommend additional practice for the student who was struggling, this would be coded with ?growth mindset- practice and effort.? This pilot study was an initial attempt to understand and document how faculty and instructors? descriptions of their teaching ascribed to two different mindsets?in one case, that of a fixed mindset, in which students? intelligence is static, and in the other case that of a growth mindset, in which students can learn with increased effort.

College admissions decisions have traditionally relied heavily on academic characteristics like GPA and standardized testing. Universities started to adopt holistic strategies while attempting to increase diversity. Yet, increasing subjective assessment may increase risk of human bias. Machine Learning (ML) could assist in admitting a more diverse student body, but algorithmic bias could be introduced. Our goal is to develop software tools to minimize human bias in admissions while actively eliminating algorithmic bias. We will examine past admissions data and identify risks of use of possible privileged values, which have historically put certain groups at a disadvantage. This tool may help reduce bias risk and select a more diverse and academically prepared group for admission.","Barbara","","Martinez Neda","barbarm@uci.edu","Department of Computer Science","University of California, Irvine","Irvine","CA","USA"

Economically devastated by the departure of the coal industry, these communities are committed to developing high-quality computing curricula for all students, beginning in their earliest years.  The poster has two components.  First,  through a mixture of qualitative measures, the poster reports on the genesis and development of the RPP.  It focuses on the RPP?s origin in leveraging the districts? existing relationship with Pennsylvania?s South Fayette School District, which has developed one of the nation?s leading programs for teacher professional development (PD) in K-12 computing.    The second component of the poster focuses on the development of a series of summer workshops for Kentucky Appalachia K-8 instructors to learn the basics of CS and CT and how to integrate these skills and concepts into existing K-8 coursework.  Of course, the RPP faced new challenges with COVID-19?most notably, the need to offer these summer workshops remotely, and adjusting the objectives and research questions accordingly.  Through focus groups with the PD instructional team and survey responses from the KY teacher workshop participants, the poster will report on the pedagogical implications of offering teacher PD exclusively online and what the ramifications have been for Pikeville and Floyd County children with the return to school in the Fall of 2020.

We developed and administered a needs survey for K-8 teachers regarding CS education as a part of a broader community-engaged project. From 251 K-8 teachers' responses, we found that CS is important to them, but there are barriers to meeting the standards. Qualitative items about needs and barriers related to CS education teachers revealed a demand for professional development and training opportunities for teachers to learn about both the technical aspects of computing education and embedding computing ideas across the K-8 curriculum. We will discuss the implications of these findings and will describe how these results will enable our efforts to provide professional learning opportunities for educators.","Michael","","Mann","mmann14@vols.utk.edu","","University of Tennessee","Knoxville","TN","USA"

Traditional plagiarism detection software like MOSS fail to give great results for assignments whose solutions are only a few lines long. We change program variable names and then search student code for those variable names. If their code backups contain the variable names, they are flagged for cheating. Our tool was used in a CS1 course that had a Spring 2020 enrollment of 1800 students. We accused 164 students for the first homework, and enforced 142 penalties (86.6% of accused students) for the first homework. Over the semester we had 452 enforced cases of cheating on homeworks, labs, and projects out of 598 accusations (75.6% of accused students). In Summer 2020 we improved the tool to speed up response time and reduce false positive rate from 24.4% to 21.9%. We built open source software using Python that searches students? code for suspicious keywords and uploads it all to a spreadsheet. We also asked students to provide their past work at the beginning of the semester. This is important because it reduces student stress and reduces false positives. Our work helps the remedial nature of communicating to students they have been flagged for cheating by having the students know that someone is monitoring their work. Students are caught breaking the rules before they develop bad habits that hinder their learning and lead to persistent cheating.","Alex","","Kassil","alexkassil@berkeley.edu","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science","University of California, Berkeley","Berkeley","CA","USA"

While this review substantially focuses on the UK, other countries, including South Africa and Ireland, have adopted a similar accreditation regime; furthermore, this work is evaluated in the context of the Washington Accord review, taking into account the memorandum's impetus for increased consistency in the UK. In parallel with this international review, the UK's Engineering Council is seeking to enhance and modernise the processes and procedures for degree accreditation (which includes the award of the protected professional title ""Chartered Engineer"") and the introduction of the new set of accreditation expectations on approved institutions. The review includes consideration of the value of accreditation to universities, students and employers. It was initiated in 2016 following two major national reviews looking at computer science and wider STEM degree accreditation. The intent is to better understand the value of professional body accreditation in computer science, as well as how to co-create improved outcomes for all accreditation stakeholders.","Alastair","","Irons","alastair.irons@sunderland.ac.uk","","University of Sunderland","Sunderland","","United Kingdom"

We draw on the quantitative and qualitative findings from a large-scale international survey (N=2,483) conducted in the immediate aftermath of closures, implementation of lockdown measures, and the shift to online delivery in March 2020. We report how those teaching the discipline of computer science (CS) across all educational levels (n=327) show significantly more positive attitudes towards the move to online learning, teaching and assessment (LT\&A) than those working in other disciplines. However, while CS practitioners across all sectors/settings consistently noted the potential opportunities of these changes, they also raised a number of wider concerns on the impact of this shift to online, especially on workload and job precarity. More specifically for the discipline of CS, there were concerns raised regarding the ability to effectively deliver technical topics online, as well as the impact on various types of formal examinations and assessment.","Tom","","Crick","thomas.crick@swansea.ac.uk","","Swansea University","Swansea","","United Kingdom"

As Computer Science course enrollments have grown, there has been a necessary increase in the number of undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants (TAs, and UTAs). TA duties often extend far beyond grading, including designing and leading lab or recitation sections, holding office hours and creating assignments. Though advanced students, TAs need proper pedagogical training to be the most effective in their roles. Training strategies have widely varied from no training at all, to semester-long prep courses. We will explore the challenges of TA training across both large and small departments. While much of the effort has focused on teams of undergraduates, most presenters have used the same tools and strategies with their graduate students. Training for TAs should not just include the mechanics of managing a classroom, but culturally relevant pedagogy.

We introduce Eye, an interactive pedagogical tool that visualizes a program?s execution as it runs. It demonstrates properties and usage of data structures in a general environment, thereby helping in learning, logical debugging, and code comprehension. Eye provides a comprehensive overview at each stage during run time including the execution stack and the state of data structures. The modular implementation allows for extension to other languages and modification of the graphics as desired.

Eye opens up a gateway for CS2 students to more easily understand myriads of programs that are available on online programming websites, lowering the barrier towards self-learning of coding. It expands the scope of visualizing data structures from standard algorithms to general cases, benefiting both teachers as well as programmers who face issues in debugging. Line by line interpreting allows Eye to describe the execution and not only the current state. We also conduct experiments to evaluate the efficacy of Eye for debugging and comprehending a new piece of code. Our findings show that it becomes faster and less frustrating to debug certain problems using this tool, and also makes understanding new code a much more pleasant experience.","Aman","","Bansal","aman0456b@gmail.com","","Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay","Mumbai","","India"

Identifying students at risk of failure at an early stage of a semester is a serious challenge in higher education, so predicting students' academic performance is one of the most essential research topics to reduce failure rates, and to improve the performance of students by the end of a semester. We are developing a predictive model based on a deep artificial neural network to predict students? academic performance of upcoming courses based on their grades in previous courses of the first academic year. We have used one of the most common resampling methods, which is the SMOTE approach to handle the problem of the imbalanced dataset. The preliminary results show that our proposed model has achieved 86% accuracy. To put our system in context, we compared our results to some traditional machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest, which were applied to an online dataset that has been widely used in some previous works. The comparison showed that our experimental results have achieved better results than the other traditional models. In future work, we will use a larger dataset to improve the accuracy of our models. Using other oversampling techniques such as SVM-SMOTE and Random Over Sampler will be used to evaluate their performance in comparison to the algorithms used in our work.","Aya","","Nabil","ayanabil@mans.edu.eg","","Faculty of Computers and Information","Mansoura","","Egypt"

However, detecting cancerous regions in whole-slide images has been challenging as it required substantial annotation and training efforts from clinicians and biologists.  This challenge was overcome by implementing active learning which is a notable instructing process that requires students? feedback to partake in the learning cycle effectively. This research adopted the active learning concept by utilizing semantic segmentation deep convolutional neural network model called U-Net which would be further integrated with active learning framework to improve the annotation and training procedure in a feedback learning process. This reduced the amount of time and effort required to analyze the whole slide images. As an active learning strategy, a low-confidence sample selection algorithm was used to improve the learning process. This system selected highly uncertain samples iteratively to strategically supply whole slide images to the training process. The performance results of the proposed approach indicated that the U-Net-based active learning framework has promising outcomes in the feedback learning process.","Vishwanshi","","Joshi","joshi12@marshall.edu","","Marshall University","Huntington","WV","USA"
"PT","src0861","Making Proof Quest Effective for An Automated Prover","","1","The goal of software verification is to establish the correctness of a program formally. Verification of programs that involve combinations of novel and sophisticated data abstractions is a challenge because their verification typically involves mathematical domains for which there are no decision procedures.

This research leverages the existing RESOLVE verifying compiler. A central piece of such a compiler is its prover. To scale up, the prover needs to instantiate and utilize appropriate theorems from arbitrary mathematical theory units. This research aims to replace the existing prototype prover with a more powerful one suitable for proving verification conditions in sequent form. 

The new prover uses a three-tiered searching strategy to optimize the proof quest by eliminating the exploration of unnecessary search spaces. The research uses generic maps and trees to experiment with the proposed strategy and evaluate the new prover.

When developing a recommender system, it is optimal to have a large dataset of user-item interaction data with which to train, test, and evaluate the model. However, many applications that could benefit from a recommender do not have access to a large dataset of user behavior relevant to that application. The research described here concerns the development of a recommender for a web application for which there does not exist a large, appropriate dataset because it is still in the late prototype phase. The first stage of this research focuses on synthesizing artificial data to use in training and testing. The complex structure of user behavior could not be captured with rule-based randomly generated data, but a strategy was discovered for transforming existing, unrelated, datasets to fit the application?s needs. This strategy can be broadly applied when developing recommenders for any application, and potentially to solve sparse data problems in other machine learning (ML) domains. With the presence of an adequate dataset, the new recommender can be effectively trained, evaluated, and compared. The second phase of research is ongoing, but preliminary results are promising.","Luke","","Kurlandski","kurlanl1@tcnj.edu","","The College of New Jersey","Ewing","NJ","USA"

Because of this, individuals of all ages need to be aware of how AI works. To introduce middle school students to AI concepts, we built a text classifier extension into a block-based programming interface that allows students to train custom machine learning models. To make the extension more accessible, a translator was incorporated where the language of each input is automatically detected and translated to English. Our classifier?s accuracy was comparable to similar classifiers such as Machine Learning for Kids? text classifier and Uclassify?s text classifier, and its effectiveness was tested against these classifiers with two test datasets. We piloted the classifier with middle school students in an online AI course. The students first learned the concepts behind the classifier which consisted of word embeddings, K-Nearest-Neighbors, and classification bias. They were then able to use the text classifier to create their own projects. Some of the projects were a snake identifier, a TV show suggester, a chat robot, and a healthcare robot. With this extension, students were able to engage in project-based learning to become more knowledgeable about the ever-growing field of AI and raise their awareness about applications of AI within their own lives.","Tejal","","Reddy","reddyt@mit.edu","Media Lab","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Cambridge","MA","USA"

Today, most deployed work in K-12 AI education takes place at strong STEM schools or during extracurricular clubs. But, to promote equity in the field of AI, we must also design curricula for classroom use at schools with limited resources. How to Train Your Robot leverages a low-cost ($40) robot, a block-based programming platform, novice-friendly model creation tools, and hands-on activities to introduce students to machine learning. During the summer of 2020, we trained in-service teachers, primarily from Title 1 public schools, to deliver a five-day, online version of the curriculum to their students. In this work, we describe how students? self-directed final projects demonstrate their understanding of technical and ethical AI concepts. Students successfully selected project ideas, taking the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning into account, and implemented an array of projects about everything from entertainment to science. We saw that students had the most difficulty designing mechanisms to respond to user feedback after deployment.

Previous ITS are good at generating feedback for coding problems with known solutions, but there exists a wide variety of coding platforms that do not publish solutions for many of their problems. These platforms are hugely popular with CS students, so a hint generator that does not require a known solution would benefit a large population of students. We attempted this task using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically BERT fine-tuning, to predict solution components. We selected three features that were easy to programmatically detect in solutions - lists, stacks, and queues - and labeled each statement with three booleans denoting whether their solutions contained each feature. Next, we fed the statements through BERT and fit several binary classifiers to the 12th layer to predict which statements had which feature. We were unsuccessful at predicting these features from the problem statements beyond the negative class proportion, possibly due to class imbalance or insufficient BERT pre-training. Because this is a new problem for ITS, we also propose a general benchmark to measure the efficacy of solution-less hint generators in hopes of informing future research.","Victor","","Suciu","vsuciu@uw.edu","","University of Washington Bothell","Bothell","WA","USA"

Using machine learning, it is possible to develop an algorithm that can quickly determine the supernova direction. In this paper, a machine learning approach to predicting the direction of supernova events are applied with promising results. Neutrinos are subatomic particles that are at least six orders of magnitudes smaller than the mass of an electron. Following Colgate and White's theory of supernova neutrino production, neutrinos emitted by supernovas can be detected before the first electromagnetic emissions can be detected. However, neutrino interactions with matter are minimal and feeble. They have no electric charge. This makes them difficult to detect. As part of this research project, we are using simulated data representing detected neutrino events from the Super-K observatory. We used 80% of the data as a training set and 20% was a testing set. Both feature and label values were normalized into the range between 0 and 1. We used a Convolutional Neural Network to process inputs from a 1D array representing the image containing event data. The overall results of the model (67% of the time, model prediction is within 5 degrees of the actual event, and 99% of the time, model prediction is within 10 degrees of the actual event) were similar to the currently used prediction methods. However, once the models are trained, the detection can be much faster, as the results can be obtained within seconds.","Tamik","","Zamaev","tamikzamaev@gmail.com","","British Columbia Institute of Technology","Burnaby","BC","Canada"

We further increased the potential for high levels of user engagement by including fun language and emojis. Overall, our project presents ANTIE in beta. The chatbot currently promotes BLM education by providing voting information, relevant news articles, terminology definitions, media recommendations, a directory of local Black-owned businesses, and other resources. We conducted pilot testing with six participants; however, we plan to gather more results via deployment to a larger audience.

The results were then compared to the students' self-reported department GPA with the goal of determining which factors predict student success. We find that students who: (1) live within 15 minutes from campus, (2) receive financial support from their family, or (3) were not responsible for physically or financially caring for their family are more likely to have a department GPA at or above a 3.0. There were other social factors examined that did not have significant correlations with GPA.

However, many students do not complete exercises with the tools used currently, as they do not know how to fix their code after getting a ?wrong answer? message. In the literature, binary feedback like this has been shown to have negative effects on student engagement, and tutors end up repeating the same feedback to many students for the same exercise. In this work, we have built a tool that groups incorrect solutions by the output they produce, to help tutors identify common programming and logic errors in student code during class. Tutors annotate incorrect outputs with suggestions, which will then be shown to students whenever their code produces the same wrong output. We carried out an exploratory case study to validate our approach, where students were able to fix both logical and presentation errors using the suggestions provided by our tool. Not all errors can be annotated, these must still be reviewed in person by a tutor. We also carried out a usability study where tutors successfully annotated solution groups. As such, the main contribution of this work is a tool that supports the work that tutors do during programming classes, letting them give richer feedback in a more scalable manner.","Florencia","","Miranda","florencia.miranda@ninaspro.cl","Departamento de Ciencias de la Computaci?n","Universidad de Chile","Santiago","","Chile"

The demand of job applicants in this field, especially in industry, are high. Yet, the supply of CS candidates to fill these positions are low. One notable reason for this phenomenon is based on the high dropout rate of majors as they matriculate through a CS curriculum. Another reason is their failure to showcase the appropriate skill-sets and related expectations needed as candidates for tech-based job opportunities. When emphasizing the latter reason, it is important to examine the current educational practices that may influence such discrepancies as students matriculate through a CS curriculum.  This extended abstract discusses one way to address this discrepancy by exploring the impact of exposing early CS majors to coding interview practices in the form of whiteboard problem solving. A virtual assessment was conducted on 30 CS students enrolled in one of two different intro level computer courses at an institution in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The results of this assessment revealed that students mostly struggled with their ability to conceptualize a given problem in order to apply the appropriate concepts to solve it effectively.","Myles","","Lewis","mylew3@morgan.edu","","Morgan State University","Baltimore","MD","USA"

The map concept and the extension both avoid explicit references and aliasing. The copy capability is implemented using a loop that goes through the entire map, pulling out each value in the map to copy, and then placing that value back into the original map and its copy, thereby keeping the original map the same while creating the copy. Verification of the extension using the RESOLVE verifying compiler successfully generates verification conditions, though they are not proved automatically at this time.

This rising demand for higher education leads to an increased workload for instructors. Open-ended textual exercises facilitate the comprehension of problem-solving skills. Offering individual feedback to help learners increase their existing knowledge by learning from mistakes is challenging: Grading textual exercises is a manual, repetitive, and time-consuming task, seldomly aided by technology. In most cases, many graders have to be employed to accommodate large student populations.

We present Athene, a computer-aided system for grading textual exercises at scale, integrated into the Artemis learning-platform. We use topic modeling to split student answers into segments. Language embeddings and clustering sort the segments into groups based on similarity. To aid graders, the system uses similarity metrics to create pre-gradings for each segment?s feedback and score. Further, we use these metrics to detect grading inconsistencies to facilitate consistent grading at scale.

We used Athene to grade 17 open-ended textual exercises in an introductory software engineering course at the Technical University of Munich with 1,800 registered students. 26% of the total assessments were pre-graded by Athene. 85% of these pre-graded assessments were not changed by an instructor. 5% were extended with a comment, and instructors overwrote 10%.

The goal of this session is to provide a practical experience addressing one of the five common goals presented previously: a learning experience for participants in how science fiction can be used in computing classrooms to teach ethics and develop CS students' facility for considering ethical situations with deeper critical thinking. Materials will be available so that the exercise can be translated to other classrooms. By providing this experience in a virtual format, participants will be able to translate it to their own setting, whether virtual or face-to-face. Building on an initial description of ethical frameworks, the exercise will be followed by discussion about ways to adapt, adjust and modify the exercise to incorporate other fictional works, to fit into a variety of courses, or to address different levels of learners.

Meanwhile, gamification increasingly attracts the interest of educators due to its potential to foster motivation and behavioral changes in learning contexts. This virtual workshop introduces participants to the concept of gamification and the use of OneUp Learning, a platform aimed at gamifying academic courses. OneUp is aimed at encouraging students' out-of-class practicing and increasing their overall engagement in the course through employing game design elements. The platform is course-independent and allows the instructor to turn on and off a number of gamification features, including avatars, points, leaderboards, progress bar, content unlocking, goal-setting, badges, virtual currency, duels, etc. For using OneUp, instructors have to provide practice exercises. Apart from the standard question types, OneUp supports Parson's and programming problems, as well as Flash cards. The workshop offers an interactive tutorial and individual work. The tutorial will introduce the OneUp platform and will demonstrate its use for gamifying a course. Workshop attendees will be engaged in hands-on experience. An OneUp course shell will be created and populated with sample data for each workshop attendee. After the tutorial, the participants will be able to explore and further gamify their own OneUp demo course. We will also demonstrate Quest, a repository for sharing OneUp problems.","Darina","","Dicheva","dichevad@wssu.edu","","Winston-Salem State University","Winston Salem","NC","USA"

The theory behind exploiting WEP and WPA2 has been available for a number of years. However, it has not been easy to offer students the opportunity to apply these theories in a real environment. In this workshop, you will learn about the WEP weakness, the different hacking scenarios where WEP access points have connected clients versus no connected clients, and the WPA2 weakness. In addition, you will have the opportunity to hack up to four WEP access points in addition to a WPA2 access point. Then, you will learn how to build and configure an exploitable WiFi environment, with necessary access points, for your students to hack. You will learn how Raspberry Pis can be used to act as the necessary clients for the access points and have access to the Raspberry Pi scripts, as well as all access point configuration directions. We will discuss pros and cons of the different architectures which allow students? remote access to the vulnerable environment.

BRIDGES provides an infrastructure for use in early CS courses that allows students to easily integrate real-world data into their routine course assignments and visualize the data and data structures of their implementations.  The BRIDGES API provides several key advantages, First, minimal effort is needed to accessing and using interesting real-world datasets in CS homework assignments.  Available data sets in BRIDGES span multiple domains, including entertainment, science, geographic data, and literature.  Second, BRIDGES can be used by students to create and explore a visualization of the data used and data structures implemented in their assignments.  Such visualizations can be used to illustrate concepts of underlying algorithm or data structure, or important data features.  Third, the BRIDGES Game API allows students to implement 2D games, to emphasize basic concepts, such as control structures, looping and logic, while providing a fun experience.  Finally, students can explore the benchmarking of algorithms in BRIDGES by using real and large data sets, emphasizing algorithm performance and computational complexity.  Workshop attendees will engage in hands-on experience with BRIDGES with multiple datasets and will have opportunities to discuss how BRIDGES can be used in their own courses.

Consistent lab execution environments and automated provisioning are provided by Docker containers.  With over 50 lab exercises including multi-component networks that all run on a modestly performing laptop computer., Labtainers supports exploratory learning for both local and remote learners. They offer automated assessment of student lab activity and progress as well as individualized lab exercises to discourage sharing solutions. Free and open at: https://nps.edu/web/c3o/labtainers, Labtainers is distributed as a single virtual machine for either VirtualBox or VMWare. On an exercise-specific basis, the framework leverages Docker containers to instantiate one or more networked computers within that single VM. This hands-on workshop covers the basics of creating Labtainer-based labs, whether for security, networking, operating systems, or other computer science classes. The workshop also introduces how this lab framework helps remove three barriers to CS lab exercises: 1) administrative setup and resulting divergent behavior between student environments; 2) sharing of solutions amongst students; 3) assessing student work. Participants should have a computer running either VMWare or VirtualBox,  with the Labtainers VM appliance installed.

Comparison activities support self-regulated learning through a process of abstraction. That is, students are facilitated to engage in a conversation with their work and produce inner feedback that becomes the raw material for their learning and development [1]. This workshop is designed to support educators in their designing and implementing effective comparison activities and administering the process to facilitate student self-regulation.  This highly interactive and collaborative workshop will provide participants with materials and ideas that are immediately useable and applicable to a wide variety of teaching practices. In particular, we guide participants in their developing insights about comparison activities for students self-regulated learning; we describe and discuss ubiquitous, implicit comparison opportunities, and facilitate participants identifying concrete opportunities for explicitly implementing comparison activities within their teaching practice; we introduce participants to a framework that guides their decisions on design and implementation; and provide case examples. These segments will be interspersed with reflective and experiential exercises to highlight the benefits and processes of comparison-based internal feedback. Comparison activities can be deployed across all learning settings including in classroom settings, individual and group assignments, and online tasks and interactions.

Hands-on activities will provide context for interesting computing ideas, like event driven programming, the concept of state, and principles of Human-Computer Interaction. We will start with a novice-friendly, block-based programming paradigm (similar to Scratch), but also show how Arcade's environment naturally scaffolds students into text-based languages as we progress to examples in JavaScript and Python (prior experience not needed). Other introductory tools often have shortcomings for games:  a) game elements, like scoring and multiplayer capabilities, can be challenging to implement and b) finished games lack features associated with ?real? games, like gamepad controls. This workshop will showcase Arcade features uniquely suited for games, such as scoring primitives and sprite data types, and how games can be deployed to low-cost consoles, comparable to Nintendo?s Gameboy. Participants will: 1) complete example games using game elements, 2) see Arcade?s use in remote education, 3) gain insight into succinct, meaningful activities for a variety of audiences (K-12, outreach, CS1), and 4) get educators' perspectives on the pros/cons of the Arcade platform.  Activities will be completed via web browsers (Chrome preferred). Deployment to hardware will be demonstrated and participants can follow along if they own hardware, but it isn't required (to acquire hardware see the ?Hardware? section of https://arcade.makecode.com/).","Bill","","Siever","bsiever@gmail.com","","Washington University in St. Louis","St. Louis","MO","USA"

Putting Data and Ethics at the Center of Introductory Computing","","1","Computing is a large and growing presence in society in 2020, and like many others, we see a strong demand from non-computing majors for ``CS For All'' courses. Unlike many others, we do not feel that putting traditional programming first is the best way to do this.  Instead, we are rethinking the way we introduce computing to allow a broad audience to engage with this discipline.</par><par>Any computational problem we might tackle requires that we explicitly think about the data involved to solve the problem.  Likewise, many computational problems potentially have deep implications for the effect of emerging technologies on society including complex racial and social justice issues.  When training novice computer scientists, too often the focus is on learning to write code, but not on explicitly learning computational thinking (data-first, declarative) and how to spot, analyze, and mitigate the ethical implications of potential computing solutions. When teaching those from other disciplines about computer science, the importance of learning to write code is diminished still further, relative to skills in computational thinking and in reasoning about ethical issues in computing and emerging technologies.

It encourages them to reflect, deal with criticism, learn better, and stay motivated. However, the lack of meaningful feedback happens to be one of the biggest challenges that online learners face. In a traditional classroom setting, instructors get more facetime with students, this allows them to gauge students? understanding and offer frequent feedback accordingly. The same cannot be said about online classes because the interaction is limited. The move to online instruction necessitates more frequent feedback on performance for both faculty and students. By having access to performance data, teachers can observe data patterns, and adjust their instruction.  In addition, norm-referenced and criterion-based data can help define the groups of students who need more intensive instruction. 
This workshop aims to show how relevant skill and conceptual knowledge descriptive tags can be introduced into a course through an online assignment grading platform. In addition, we will show how instructors can then analyze and develop interactive visuals of student and class performance. During the workshop, participants will gain experience developing assignments, grading assignments, tagging assignments, and producing data visuals to create individual feedback on course learning outcomes. 
Since this is a virtual workshop, participants will be responsible for providing their own equipment. Required supplies include 1) computer or laptop with working camera, microphone, and speakers 2) internet speeds adequate for streaming video.

"PT","w734","STARS Ignite: A Program for Supporting Professors in Organizing Student Cohorts for Conferences","","1","Academic computing departments are seeking ways to broaden participation, and many are encouraging individual faculty, staff, and students to attend diversity-oriented conferences, like the Tapia and STARS Celebrations of Diversity in Computing and Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. Such conferences present opportunities to meet a broader community of people for professional development and networking, to be inspired by leaders in computing, and to celebrate diversity. However, while many institutions sponsor these conferences and support individual student attendance, students may not know how to leverage these opportunities effectively. We argue that leading a cohort of faculty/staff and students who attend a conference with the shared goal of broadening participation can provide lasting benefits for computing departments. This workshop will prepare faculty and staff to recruit and lead a team of students and leverage conference attendance to ignite broadening participation efforts. Through a hands-on collaborative process, the workshop provides the knowledge and tools needed to successfully lead a cohort, and helps attendees tailor the provided tools to their local strengths and needs to broaden participation in computing.","Amy","","Isvik","aaisvik@ncsu.edu","","North Carolina State University","Raleigh","NC","USA"

"PT","w736","Grading for Equity&#58; A Curriculum Development and Grading Process to Enhance Instruction","","0","In Grading for EQUITY: What It Is, Why It Matters, and How It Can Transform Schools and Classrooms, Joe Feldman states ?The ways we grade disproportionately favor students with privilege and disproportionately harm students with less privilege.? (2019, pp. xxii-xxiii) This workshop provides a process to make grading practices more equitable. The process includes: 1) analyzing course goals to yield desired course outcomes; 2) developing assessments of the outcomes; 3) developing learning activities; 4) adopting a different approach to grading assessments; and 5) developing an appropriate overall grading scheme. With some practice and discussion with peers you can implement an equitable grading process that revolutionizes your instructional practice. Grading will: no longer address student behavior subject to bias; incorporate better mathematical practices becoming more accurate, lack bias; and be motivating. Grading For Equity alleviates: the homework grading burden with feedback ignored by students; worries about cheating on homework; and arguing with students about points while it allows instructors to focus on working with students in a professional and less stressful manner. Workshop activity will address all five process elements noted above. Participants need to view a background presentation prior to the workshop and will receive sample outcomes, assessments, and grading suggestions for various types of courses in addition to workshop products.","Andrew","","Berns","adberns@cs.uni.edu","Computer Science","University of Northern Iowa","Cedar Falls","IA","USA"

"PT","w737","CSAwesome&#58; A Free Curriculum and Ebook for Advanced Placement Computer Science A (CS1 in Java)","","0","This hands-on online workshop will introduce high school and college instructors to CSAwesome, a free Java curriculum and ebook at course.csawesome.org for the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science (CS) A course. This course is equivalent to a college-level CS1 course in Java. CSAwesome is an official College Board approved curriculum and professional development provider and has been widely adopted by AP high school teachers.

The free ebook on the Runestone platform includes executable Java code examples and a variety of practice problems with immediate feedback: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, write-code, mixed-up code (Parsons), and clickable code. It also includes coding challenges and support for pair programming. The curriculum is designed to help transition students from AP Computer Science Principles, which is equivalent to a CS0 course. Teacher lesson plans and resources are freely available.

During this workshop, participants will register for the free ebook and work through example activities using object-oriented programming. If possible, participants will be divided into breakout groups according to their Java expertise. Participants will also learn how to create a custom course on the Runestone platform, create and grade assignments, use the instructor?s dashboard to view student progress, contribute to the question bank, and use an interleaved spaced practice tool. We will also discuss online/hybrid teaching and engagement strategies.","Beryl","","Hoffman","hoffmanb@elms.edu","Computer Science","Elms College","Chicopee","MA","USA"

"PT","w741","Transform Your Computer Science Course with Specifications Grading","","1","As proposed by Linda B. Nilson in Specifications Grading: Restoring Rigor, Motivating Students, and Saving Faculty Time, specifications grading is an assessment paradigm that relies on pass/fail grading of assignments and assessments, the structuring of course content into modules linked to learning outcomes, and the bundling of assignments and assessments within those modules. One of the intentions of this type of course grading construct is to align assessment more closely with student attainment of intended learning outcomes. While there has been very visible work in incorporating specifications grading in some academic areas (e.g. in mathematics), examples of the use of specifications grading in computer science courses are less common. The goal of this workshop is to introduce the concepts of specifications grading, explain how to apply these concepts to a wide range of computing courses and class sizes, and have the participants apply these concepts to one of their current or upcoming computer science courses. Each participant should leave the workshop with at least one revised course syllabus or assignment that incorporates specifications grading. Access to examples and resources will be provided.","David","L.","Largent","dllargent@bsu.edu","Department of Computer Science","Ball State University","Muncie","IN","USA"

"PT","w755","Teaching about Heterogeneous Computing","","0","CS faculty have spent the last several years adding parallel computing to their curricula since essentially all processors sold today have multiple cores. A typical target system is a multicore processor with identical cores.  This is currently the main configuration for desktop and laptop systems, but the technology continues to evolve and systems are incorporating several kinds of heterogeneity. Many phone processors include cores of different sizes, with high-performance ""fat cores"" and lower-performance ""thin cores"", allowing the phone to vary its power and performance profile over time. Other processors incorporate low-power modes or special instructions for specialized computations. Meanwhile, high-end systems make heavy use of accelerators such as graphics cards.  We are at a stage where heterogeneous computing concepts should pervade the curriculum rather than being limited to upper-level courses.

In this workshop, we present modules to incorporate heterogeneous computing into core CS courses taken by all majors (e.g. CS 1, CS 2, Computer Organization). Attendees will have time to work through lab exercises and assignments associated with the modules while we assist.  We will provide post-workshop support for instructors interested in adopting the modules.  In addition, we will solicit feedback from them to help guide our future module development.

"PT","w756","Teaching with the Beauty and Joy of Computing &#150; AP CSP and More!","","0","The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) is a CS Principles (CSP) course created at UC Berkeley to reach high school and university non-majors in computer science. It was chosen for the CSP pilot and endorsed by the College Board as an AP CSP curriculum and PD provider since the first AP CSP exam sitting in 2017. In this workshop, we will provide an overview of the BJC curriculum including course materials, teacher resources, and an introduction to Snap!, the chosen visual programming language of BJC. We will not only cover curriculum updates, Snap! updates, BJC for middle school, BJC in other languages, but also dive into labs with hands-on programming. Some of our experienced BJC Lead Teachers will provide support and answer questions based on personal classroom experience. This workshop is intended to be an introduction and update to the Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum (bjc.edc.org) and community. This is not intended to be an in-depth experience, but an overview. Note: It is recommended to use least a Chromebook during the workshop in order to achieve the learning outcomes. Also, having Multiple/dual monitors will make for a  better experience. ","Marnie","","Hill","mehill6@ncsu.edu","","NC State University","Raleigh","NC","USA"

"PT","w757","Using CSTA Standards for CS Teachers to Design CS Teacher Pathways","","1","As primary and secondary computer science offerings expand across the United States and other countries, there is a growing demand for educators who can teach CS. One way to meet the demand is to include CS content and instruction in teacher preparation programs, at the inservice (practicing teachers) and/or preservice (becoming a teacher) levels. This workshop is designed for higher education faculty from CS and Education departments as well as teachers who support CS education programs and would like to learn more about creating pathways for preparing teachers to teach CS. The workshop will provide rationales for CS teacher preparation programs (including how to develop and sustain the programs), detail what teachers need to know and be able to do to teach CS, review dimensions and examples of existing programs, and share resources to support CS teacher preparation program development. Participants will have an opportunity in the last hour to work on developing a CS program for their institution and writing an action plan of 2-3 short term goals to support program development.

"PT","w762","Effective Video Production for Online and In-Person Courses","","0","This workshop will be a tutorial on effective media production for computer science courses.  We?ll spend time breaking down the ways that you can use media in your courses, both live and pre-recorded. Good media production relies heavily on both well-planned curriculum and pre-production. As part of this, we?ll focus on our work building courses around short 5-10 minute videos, which have been shown to encourage engagement from students. We?ll discuss designing your content and process for efficient turn around, so that you can successfully build a course ?just in time?. 

The goal of the workshop is to share with participants the techniques we use in our own courses. We?ll demo our workflows and favorite tools, with pointers on where to learn more. Along the way, we?ll share how you can accomplish a well-produced video with minimal budgets, and where you can get the most out of adding hardware and software to your setup.

This workshop will be highly interactive. For each topic, we?ll start off with live demonstrations, but then spend time with hands-on questions from participants. Participants are encouraged to bring their questions and challenges to the workshop.
