## Author Guidelines: Demos

Demos provide a way to showcase an educational tool or project in a live setting. Not designed to be sales pitches, demonstrations are a way for the community to see the relevance, potential, and innovation of the tool and allow time for discussion with its creator. 

For SIGCSE TS 2021, Demos will be a maximum of 20 minutes each, with at least 10-15 minutes allocated for answering questions. The Demo format is significantly different this year with Demos held in a regular session at a fixed time slot, rather than during coffee breaks where the longer time slot was used to accommodate audience members arriving at different times. These changes have been introduced to accommodate the virtual setting of the symposium to the best extent possible.

## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?
{% include authorguidelines-planning.html %}

Demo proposals are submitted in PDF format. The full proposal contains an abstract and a body that describes your Demo (as detailed below). The full proposal is used for the review process only. If the proposal is accepted, the title and authors appear in the printed program and the title, authors, and abstract appear in the online program and proceedings. The format for the proposal is described in the following section.

### Demo Proposal Format and Contents

* **Proposer**: Include name(s), affiliation, email address, and website address. You should expect most correspondence related to the conference to arrive via email. Please check your spam filter if you haven’t received an expected notification because the auto-responses generated by the conference software are sometimes blocked.

* **Title**: A descriptive title for the Demo.

* **Abstract**: A description of the Demo. The same abstract will also need to be submitted via a text box on the submission page. Please be sure that your description is accurate and that both submitted copies (here in the Demo Proposal, and in the submission text box) are exactly the same. Please recall that the abstract is the only part of the proposal to appear in program and proceedings and should thus be self-contained.

* **Significance and Relevance of the Topic**: Please include information about any trends in relation to the tool/project and possibly describe (or cite) evidence to that effect. Your objective here is to explain why the tool/project is significant. Explain why the tool/project is important for the Computing Education Community and what the expected benefits by using it with regard to learning computing topics  are. Ideally also explain ideas for courses/topics where the tool/project is beneficial and provide evidence, if possible.

* **Expected Audience**: Briefly describe the nature and size of the expected audience. This information will help gauge the level of interest SIGCSE Technical Symposium attendees will have in the Demo.

* **Other Presenter(s)**: Although correspondence will be with the proposer above, it will be the discussion leader(s) who will be mentioned in Symposium literature. Please list any additional such names (besides the proposer) and affiliations here. Be certain that you have their commitments to attend the Symposium. All presenters must register for the SIGCSE Technical Symposium and be present for the Demo session online.

* **Expertise of Presenter(s)**: Give a summary of the qualifications of the presenter(s) as it relates to the tool/project being proposed.

* **Agenda for the Demo**: Timing details would be helpful here. Explain what the attendees can expect. Be sure to budget a realistic amount of time for questions from attendees. Describe how you will interact with and engage attendees.

* **Virtual requirements**: Indicate any specific requirements you may have **since your Demo is going to be virtual**. Note that not all requirements might be met by the conferencing software used. At the time of acceptance more information about the conferencing software’s capabilities will be available.

### Tips for Creating an Effective Demo

* Interactivity with the audience!

* While proposed agendas may change, you should be as detailed in your agenda as possible.  Illustrate the specific activities you have in mind to the best of your ability.

* Make sure that you are explicit about what *you* want to get out of the Demo experience.  As described above, Demos are meant for you (the presenter) to get exposure for your tool or to generate discussion.  However, it is helpful for your reviewers to understand if you are looking to find users, vet future research directions, etc.

### Demo Proposal Abstract

The abstract is the description of the Demo that will appear on the conference web pages. The description is limited to and must match verbatim the abstract section of the Demo Proposal. The Demo abstract must be submitted in plain text. The abstract for an accepted proposal may contain a URL with more information. (Abstracts of accepted Demos can be edited in response to reviews.)

### Virtual Demos

Since the conference will be virtual, each Demo will be presented live via a virtual platform.  The 20 minute Demo would start with a 5-10 minute presentation followed by 10-15 minutes of Q&A and additional demoing based on questions from the attendees.

### General Requirements

Independent of your presentation, you will have to provide a pre-recorded video with an overview of the Demo of at most 5 minutes length. The video must be provided before the symposium starts (exact date TBA) and will be referenced from the online program in order to give attendees the chance to get acquainted with the Demo beforehand. It may also widen the potential audience for your Demo. Note that this is an additional requirement in comparison to Demos at previous symposiums due to the addition of virtual offerings at the symposium.
