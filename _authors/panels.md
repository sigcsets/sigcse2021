## Author Guidelines: Panel Session
{% include alert info='Current as of August 13 2020' %}
 
Panel sessions provide an opportunity for expert panel members to present their views on a specific topic and then to discuss these views among themselves and with the audience. Usually, a panel session starts with a brief introduction of the panel topic and the participants, followed by short presentations by the panelists giving their views. They are scheduled in standard conference spaces. The session must allow sufficient opportunity (about 30 minutes) for an interactive question and answer period involving both the panelists and the audience.
 
A typical panel will consist of four participants, including the moderator. Limiting a panel to four participants allows sufficient time for audience questions. Proposals with more than four panelists must convincingly show that all panelists will be able to speak, and the audience able to respond, within the session time.

Criteria used in reviewing the proposals include the likely level of interest of the topic, the presence of panel members with multiple perspectives on the topic and significant expertise and experience, and the likelihood that the panel will leave sufficient time for audience participation.
 
If the proposal is accepted, all presenters listed in the panel description will be required to register for the conference and to participate in the session.
 
## Planning for a virtual session
The SIGCSE 2021 Technical Symposium will be virtual.  We believe that panels can be conducted productively in this virtual format, but proposers will need to explicitly plan their session to be successful in this format.  Panels should need relatively few changes from their in-person setting, but a strong plan for moderating questions from the audience productively in a virtual setting will be necessary.  You must include in your proposal details of how the panel will be run in virtual format.   Please do not refer to specific technologies.  Instead focus on the process that you will use to make sure remote panelists and participants are engaged and included.
 
## Resubmitting an accepted Panel from 2020
Normally repeat submission of the same Panel in back-to-back years is discouraged, but because the 2020 Technical Symposium was canceled, it is fine to resubmit an accepted Panel from 2020 for consideration for the 2021 Technical Symposium.  However, please take note of the following:
1. You must have a clear plan for a virtual format in your submission.
1. You should clearly indicate in your submission that this is a resubmission of an accepted panel from 2020.
1. If accepted, the abstract will not be republished, but your panel will run in the 2021 Symposium. 
1. There is no guarantee that a panel will be accepted this year just because it was accepted last year.  Having it accepted last year will not hurt or improve the chances that it is accepted this year.  
 
 
## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?
{% include authorguidelines-planning.html %}
 
The proposal is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.submissions.panels.limits}} and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines:
{% include template-information.html %}
 
The following modifications and exceptions do apply:
 
-   When providing author information, indicate which of the panelists
    is the moderator by placing the word "Moderator" in parentheses
    after their name.
 
-   **Abstract:** Should provide a brief summary of your panel.
 
- 	**Summary:** The first section should be titled Summary and should provide an expanded summary of the panelâ€™s goals,  intended audience, and relevance to the SIGCSE community written by the moderator.  If this is a resubmission of a panel that was accepted for the 2020 Symposium, please indicate this.
 
-	**Panel Structure:** The section following the summary should explain the panel structure and plan for audience participation and provide sufficient time for audience interaction and questions. **NEW for 2021**, this section should explicitly describe how a virtual panel will be structured and run.
 
-	**Position Statements:** The subsequent sections should contain the position statements of each panelist and a brief description of their expertise and background as it relates to the panel. Title each section by identifying the panelist.
 
-	**References:** Citing relevant work where appropriate is encouraged, but not required. If they are included, they should be placed in a separate section titled References and should follow the formatting guidelines.
 
If accepted, the panel description will be allocated
{{site.data.submissions.panels.limits}}  in the conference proceedings
and must adhere to the formatting guidelines specified above. To
facilitate the transition from proposal to camera-ready copy, it is
critical that authors adhere closely to the formatting specifications
and page limits.

## Presenting at SIGCSE TS 2021

### Important Dates

* __January 15__ - Submit presentation plans (including a video if desired) through submission form emailed to corresponding authors 

### How will I be presenting my work? (Panels and Special Sessions)

Panels and special sessions are different from paper presentations in that the live discussion itself is the primary content, rather than the published work.  To accommodate this, panels and special session presenters have several options to choose from in how they want to run their session:

* Prerecord the session and make that available through Pathable before the Symposium and then use the live session during the Symposium for longer discussion and Q&A (NOTE: Break out groups will not be possible due to using a Zoom webinar rather than a Zoom meeting.  We have to use webinars due to the number of potential attendees.)
* Provide primer material for potential attendees to view ahead of time (e.g. presentations, PDFs) through Pathable, but do not prerecord any content
* Do the entire session live during the Technical Symposium with no early material provided

Note that all panels and special sessions will be recorded and made available on-demand through Pathable for a year following the end of the Symposium.

Panels and special sessions are highly encouraged to discuss with all presenters what makes the most sense for their session.  Questions on what might work best can be directed to the Panels and Special Sessions Track Chairs at [panels@sigcse2021.org](panels@sigcse2021.org).

Pathable uses embedded Zoom windows in the web application for video presentations, so the experience will be familiar to most presenters.  A session chair will moderate the session and we will have technical support available all week to assist as needed.

More information regarding the live sessions, including time slot assignments, will be available in January.
