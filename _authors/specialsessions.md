## Author Guidelines: Special Session

{% include alert info='Current as of August 13 2020' %}
 
Special sessions are your opportunity to customize and experiment with the SIGCSE Technical Symposium format. Special sessions should NOT replicate existing session formats (i.e., panels, paper presentations, poster sessions, etc.) that are part of the SIGCSE Technical Symposium. They are scheduled in standard conference spaces. Within these constraints, the form is yours to design, keeping in mind that the 2021 Technical Symposium will be 100% virtual.
 
For example, a special session might be a tutorial or seminar, a committee report, a curricular or accreditation forum, or a hands-on (remote) demo of dance moves proven to improve retention of computing topics.
 
Possible topic areas include management of large classes, projects and assignments, teaching computer science in K-12, experiments on collaborative learning, report of an ACM committee addressing issues at two-year colleges, or special issues arising when teaching computing outside of North America.
 
{% include review-anonymity.html %}
 
Criteria used in reviewing the proposals will include the likely level of interest in the session and the suitability and feasibility of the proposed format to its topic. If the proposal is accepted, all presenters listed in the special session description will be required to register for the conference and to participate in the session.
 
## Planning for a virtual session
The SIGCSE 2021 Technical Symposium will be virtual.  We believe that special sessions can be conducted productively in this virtual format, but proposers will need to explicitly plan their session to be successful in this format.  Some sessions (e.g. committee reports with Q&A) might need relatively little modifications, while others (e.g. brainstorming sessions with attendees in small groups) might require a fundamentally different structure.   You must include in your proposal details of how the session will be run in virtual format.   Please do not refer to specific technologies.  Instead focus on the process that you will use to make sure remote participants are engaged and included.
 
## Resubmitting an accepted Special Session from 2020
Normally repeat submission of the same Special Session in back-to-back years is discouraged, but because the 2020 Technical Symposium was canceled, it is fine to resubmit an accepted Special Session from 2020 for consideration for the 2021 Technical Symposium.  However, please take note of the following:
1. You must have a clear plan for a virtual format in your submission.
1. You should clearly indicate in your submission that this is a resubmission of an accepted session from 2020.
1. If accepted, the abstract will not be republished, but your session will run in the 2021 Symposium. 
1. There is no guarantee that a Special Session will be accepted this year just because it was accepted last year.  Having it accepted last year will not hurt or improve the chances that it is accepted this year.  
 
## How Should The Proposal Be Formatted?
{% include authorguidelines-planning.html %}
 
The proposal is limited to a maximum of {{site.data.submissions["special sessions"].limits}} and must adhere to ACM's publication guidelines.
{% include template-information.html %}
 
The following modifications and exceptions apply:
 
* **Abstract**: Should provide a brief summary describing your special session including session objective, intended audience, and relevance to the SIGCSE community.
 
* Subsequent sections should contain the following information:
 
	* **Overall objective of the session**: Describe the topic of the special session and explain how the session will be organized (e.g., as a committee report, tutorial, hands-on exercise, â€¦). Indicate why the proposed session is important and relevant to the SIGCSE community.  If this is a resubmission of a session that was accepted for the 2020 Symposium, please indicate this.
 
	* **Outline of the session**: Organize this section by subtopics, activities, or a similar scheme. If more than one participant is involved, label each section of the outline with the name of the participant who will be presenting that section. Note that in the case of a committee report, the presenters might be a subset of the authors. We suggest that you allow at least 40 - 50% of the time for questions and answers or other interaction with the attendees.
 
	* ***NEW for 2021!* Plan for holding the session virtually**: Explicitly address how will you ensure that the session is still productive in a virtual format.  How will you manage the session virtually, and how will remote participants engage with session leaders?
 
	* **Expectations**: State the intended audience. Indicate how much the session will cover and what the audience should learn. If feedback from the audience is desired, indicate how it will be elicited. Explicitly stating these expectations is particularly important if your proposed special session is a tutorial.
 
	* **Suitability for a special session**:  Include a brief description that justifies the inclusion of this presentation as a special session. Explain why the proposed presentation is better suited for a special session than a paper or panel.
 
	* **References**: Citing relevant work where appropriate is encouraged, but not required. If they are included, they should be placed in a separate section titled References and should follow the formatting guidelines.
 
 
If accepted, the special session description will be allocated
{{site.data.submissions["special sessions"].limits}} in the conference proceedings
and must adhere to the formatting guidelines specified above. To
facilitate the transition from proposal to camera-ready copy, it is
critical that authors adhere closely to the formatting specifications
and page limits.

## Presenting at SIGCSE TS 2021

### Important Dates

* __January 22__ - Submit presentation plans (including a video if desired) through submission form emailed to corresponding authors 

### How will I be presenting my work? (Panels and Special Sessions)

Panels and special sessions are different from paper presentations in that the live discussion itself is the primary content, rather than the published work.  To accommodate this, panels and special session presenters have several options to choose from in how they want to run their session:

* Prerecord the session and make that available through Pathable before the Symposium and then use the live session during the Symposium for longer discussion and Q&A (NOTE: Break out groups will not be possible due to using a Zoom webinar rather than a Zoom meeting.  We have to use webinars due to the number of potential attendees.)
* Provide primer material for potential attendees to view ahead of time (e.g. presentations, PDFs) through Pathable, but do not prerecord any content
* Do the entire session live during the Technical Symposium with no early material provided

Note that all panels and special sessions will be recorded and made available on-demand through Pathable for a year following the end of the Symposium.

Panels and special sessions are highly encouraged to discuss with all presenters what makes the most sense for their session.  Questions on what might work best can be directed to the Panels and Special Sessions Track Chairs at [panels@sigcse2021.org](panels@sigcse2021.org).

Pathable uses embedded Zoom windows in the web application for video presentations, so the experience will be familiar to most presenters.  A session chair will moderate the session and we will have technical support available all week to assist as needed.

More information regarding the live sessions, including time slot assignments, will be available in January.
